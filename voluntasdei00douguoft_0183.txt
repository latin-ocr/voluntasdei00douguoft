CHAPTER XII

INDIVIDUAL WEAL

Thc sense of individual imperfectiori is a pledge of progress and of ultimate
perfection.

Only as regards moral imperfectiori does man feel he could have done better,
while history emphasises the attainment of moral perfectiori in one
mstance.

A perfect environrnent is necessary for a perfect life, but life determines its
own environincnt.

The one morally perfect man proclaimed a new environment.

The necessity for interaction of perfect outer conditions and perfect inner
life in order to perfectionis also seen in animal and plant life.

Processes of selection and growth are never instantaneous.

So if perfect environment came to-morrow all men or some rnen must be
ready to manifest a corresponding perfection of inner life, if the perfect
condition is to be permanent.

All students of the Gospels admit that Jesus proclaimed the coming of a
perfect cnvironment—the Kingdom of God, and also proclaimed the life of
the Kingdom already present in the hearts of some men, and gave the
signs by which it could be known.

In view of one divine purpose through all things, we shall look for corre-

spondence of those signs described by Jesus with the characteristics of
fullest life in evolutionary development.

Main distinctions between inorganic and organic life:

1. Organic life adapts itself to its condition& Gentleness is of the
essence not only of vegetable life but of animal life. The violence
even of beasts of prey is incidental; without gentleness and self-
sacrifice they would perish.

2. Organic life works through age-long process to new forms; the
changes of inorganic life mark little progress. Illustrations ι sand
and cacti, etc.

This power of initiation, characteristic of all organic life, must mark
fitness for the Kingdom.

3. Organic life has capacity for greater difference, and also closer union,
than inorganic. These characteristics are intensest in men, in
whom the profoundest difference is marked by personality, and the
closest union becomes brotherhood.

Human brotherhood is shown (a) in services to others rendered incidentally
in furthering one's own ends (not a distinctively human function) and
(b) in services consciously rendered to the collective good at the sacrifice
of private good. This is distinctively human, and must characterise the
ideal man and the ideal society.

Man must have this perfect social temper before he is fit for the perfect
earthly environment.
