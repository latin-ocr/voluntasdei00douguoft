INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . 1

There are three common hypotheses of the origin of our universe.

These three set forth by analogies and examined—

1. The Materialistic hypothesis—that all things mechanically
evolve, and are mere combinations of matter.

2. The Psychic hypothesis—that spirit, potential in matter,
has been the formative principle and will become more
and more dominant.

3. The God hypothesis.

The strong and weak points of each hypothesis considered.

If all three were equally reasonable, the fact that the third satisfies
feeling and activity as well as reason is likely to make it always
the belief of the greater part of mankind 3 but there is no moral
defect involved in the acceptance of any of these theories by men
who honestly find their natures satisfied by them. The theist
must whole-heartedly allow that an honest man's intelligent
adherence to what seems to him truth cannot be offensive to
God3 while materialist or psychist must not accuse theist of
lack of candour for adhering to the God hypothesis even though
his reason may not be wholly satisfied 3 for it is probably quite
as candid to adhere to what satisfies volitional and emotional
nature, although reason be not wholly convinced, as to reject
a satisfying belief merely because no reasonable proof can be
offered.

The fact of the diverse and unnumbered multitude living in what
they believe to be consciousness of God is considered as weighing
down the scale on the side of the God hypothesis.
