260 VOLUNTAS DEI emp.

foolish to go on asserting that God ordains pain
either for the punishment of the evil or the
discipline of the good.

Let us come to the matter from another point
of vieW. Do we believe that God ordains sin?
If not, we are bound to admit that He permits
what He does not ordain. We cannot retain our
moral sense and suppose that God ordains sin;
therefore we are driven to think that in the case
of sin He permits what He does not ordain 3 and
I do not think in this respect we can differentiate sin
and the suffering which is its product. (We speak
thus of God permitting what He does not ordain
although in abstract thought we cannot justify
the distinction.)

In our own world sin and suffering are in-
extricably mixed. Many physical diseases are the
causes of moral obliquity, just as truly as moral
obliquity is the cause of physical disease‚ and the
noblest human suffering of which we can conceive
being that which is invariably caused by sin in the
object of regard, we must conceive this to be the
sort of pain that God suffers. His pain is caused
by the sin of others ; our noblest pain is caused by
the sin of others; our minor pains are inextricably
mixed up with sin.1 And this is just as true if
for the word “ sin '' we substitute a name for the
same thing that is not religious, and call it “wrong’'
or “ moral defect.''

Believing in individual immortality we are com-
pelled to believe that our earthly conditions, whether

¹ I am assuming that if our social life were sinless death would never be
painsul or premature and loss would have no sting.
