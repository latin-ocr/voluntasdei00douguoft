xx SALVA'I'ION BY JOY 271

Can the most determined Protestant amongst
us imagine that, wherever and whatever the after—
life may be, any dogma of science or religion
asserts that we shall be oblivious of (J'od's constant
work of reconciling this world to Himself? If
not oblivious, shall we be indifferent or inactive?
I think rather, that all the intimations of a true
xnysticism, all the indications of Christianity truly
interpreted, all the indications of sound science,
point to the belief that every ascending degree of
progress brings with it a keener consciousness of
the inter-dependence of the parts of any whole, and
that we cannot in any immortal condition live unto
God without living unto all our fellows In some
way not only the thing that we might have been and
were not, but the conditions that we might have
had and had not, must be realised in others before
we can go forward untrammelled.

It has, I think, been shown again and again in
the world’s history. that the power to think of
abstract spirit is not by any means the channel of
the highest spiritual life, although those who pos-
sess this power are apt to speak of material con-
ceptions of perfectiori as gross and unspiritual.
I think it will be found that the fullest spiritual
life has always flowed through those conceptions
of present and future life which were the best
adjustment of the inner and spiritual to the out-
ward and visible aspect of life. For example, the
doctrine of progress through repeated re-incar—
nations carried with it a higher sense of moral
responsibility and human unity than the doctrine
of man in a static immortality as a bodiless shade.
