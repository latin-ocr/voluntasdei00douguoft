I take it, then, as proved that the method by
which organic life established itself and grew and
became the ruler of earth, was the method of
managing the forces about it, adapting itself to
them. This gentleness is the first distinction of
organic life.

Secondly, these tiny beginnings of life had in
them a power for the positive working out of law
for its own ends of which inanimate matter in any
of its forms gives little indication. Earth and
air, fire and water, are, in their greatest activity,
capable of a chiefly negative obedience to their
ordinary rules of behaviour, or, as we say, to
the laws that govern them; they do not trans—
gress those laws in their maddest play, in their
blindest rage, in their most profound transmuta—
tions. And the keeping of law with them seems
an endless repetition, because through all their
changes they seem only to relapse into what was
before. Life, on the other hand, is positive,
working along the laws of its existence to 'produce
something that is always a fetch from the un—
known. What we know as law in nature can
give very little account of the variations or
developments of organic life. What is there,
for example, in the vegetation of the age in
which our earliest coal beds were stored that
gives promise of the sort of vegetation we have
to—day ? What was there in the earliest forms of
animal life to give exact prophecy of the fauna
of to-day? As far as we are able to judge of
thousands of possibilities which might have called
creatures into being, a few were actually reahsed,
