11 CREATIVE PURPOSE 41

responding to that creative Intelligence. When
human intelligence can respond we get what we
call “ spiritual life.'’

Ι cannot regard ‘⁶ the spiritual nature '' in man
as a separate power ; rather, I believe that, as the
result of the direction of a man's ordinary powers
toward God, he gets that consciousness of God's
existence, and of his own ability to obey or defy
God, which we commonly attribute to a “ spiritual
nature '' and speak of as “ spiritual life.'' ¹

We find that this last-developed, and as it
seems to us highest, form in which human life can
rightly exercise itself, gives man more power than
any other of drawing in deep draughts of the
universal life, and using it to fashion some portion
of the earth into some higher stage in which the
purpose of God can bear upon it more directly.

This is a conception in which, looking within
ourselves and without, we find ourselves at home.
“We feel that we are greater than we knOW‚''
because we can, at times, transcend our ordinary
power of assimilating the life principle of the
universe. “We feel that we are greater than we
know,‘' because it is only in more complete union
with God that we can thus transcend our ordinary
powers. If we could conceive of a tree as having
some dim form of psychic life or consciousness, it
will be within that consciousness that it must feel
the wellspring of life, and within it also must be
dimly aware of the direction of God. Without it
lie the conditions of its growth and permanence as
an individual tree, but all its powers of assimilation
