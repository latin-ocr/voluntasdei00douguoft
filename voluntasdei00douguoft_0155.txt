CHAPTER X

OMNIPOTENCE

The simplest idea of omnipotence is analogous to the power of an adult over
a little child.

This power may be analysed into three sorts in an ascending scale—-

1. Power to change the place of matter, i.e., to move the child's body.
2. Power to influence the child's behaviour.
3. Power to conceive of the effect desired.

The effect desired may be (a) mere acquiescence3 or (b) intelligent acqui-
escence3 or (c) a good balance of spontaneity and acquiescence.

Power may also be reckoned quantitatively. The power that lasts longest
and extends over the greatest range is the greatest degree of power.

Government by force can belong only to the infancy of the child or of the
race.

A clear conception of a strong character to be moulded, and sels-restraint in
the process of evoking it, mark the highest degree of power in the adult
over a child.

If to this were added the power to create the child, we should get the corn-
plete notion of creative and administrative power which we associate
with Omnipotence.

To get our simplest conception of creation let us imagine a gardener creating
a rose. He must exhibit‚ first, power to conceive the rose character.
His conception must extend to all possible varieties of the rose life.

At the same time to form the conception is to set its limits.

These limits are two-fold—-the outward and visible possibilities, and the
character of the inner secret life.

If we attribute to such a life any power of sels-direction, it follows that the
creator-gardener cannot know which possibility will develop and which
will fail. His power, after creation‚ will be of the same nature as that of
the adult over the child.

In both cases higher power is strictly regulated in relation to inferior power,
its secret being the ability to conceive an end and regulate action toward
that end.

Hence this must be our conception of Omnipotence.

The creation of the finite must therefore involve the sels-regulation of the
Infinite.

If 50, how can we assume we understand the degree of sels-limitation.

If the end Omnipotence has in view is a form of created life able to freely
