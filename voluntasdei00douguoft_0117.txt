highest unity must be a union of persons, because
personality is essential separation. Furthermore,
this unity between persons must be a union of

union of purpose, that is community of goal3 it
must be a unity of emotion that generates a
common life3 it must be a union of thought
which gives to all things a common interpretation
and generates 3 new, creative imagination. It
must be all these in one, and if it is to satisfy
seeking humanity, one person of this unity must
be greater than man, must approach him from the
unseen, toward which he has always looked for
