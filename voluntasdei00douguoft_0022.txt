The facts of the universe are a parable from which we must abstract
a meaning.

But only that interpretation which has been thoroughly assimilated
can be perfectly articulate. When articulate it is a less perfect
interpretation than that to which the mind is already advancing.

We dimly see in the creative process the Source of life, the
developing life, and the relation of potential urnity between them.

The nature of the Source is indicated by the quality of the develop-
ment—energy into life, life into sels-hood.

Illegitimate anthropomorphism perhaps consists in assuming that
what we know as sels-hood reveals the absolute nature of the
source.

It is because the Incarnation indicates vital union with the Source
notwithstanding our ignorance‚ that it is of such vast importance.

What should we expect the revelation to be that carne to and
through one whose human will was perfectly united to the
Divine will?

1. That he would reveal more truly the nature ofGod in His re-
lation to creation——God as the supreme lover of humanity‚
the supreme sufferes with humanity, and the supreme
attraction of humanity.

2. That he would reveal more truly the results of the divine
influence on the world, laying emphasis on the repairing
of disaster, ‘⁶ binding up that which is broken‚’⁷ “ healing
that which is sick.''

This activity of the Creator, when applied to free, self-conscious
mind, produces the higher social development of the individual
by means of a higher psychic environment. The highest and
most universal of human societies are the great religions3 hence
we should expect the Christ to found a great religion.

The religion founded by the ideal man will bring into man's way
of seeing life that order and proportion which best enables him
to co-operate with the Creator in lifting up the human tace
and all creation to conformity with the Divine desire.

We should expect that order to set first the universal wea13 next,
the racial wea13 and, lastly, the individual weal. In the next
chapters we shall consider the attitude of Christianity to these
three ends, taking them in the order in which practically men
have to face them.

ultimate perfection.
