Just as in long biological evolution we can see
the physical senses coming to different degrees of
perfection-here, in this creature, the lens of the
eye became transparent3 there, in that form of
life, it developed adjustment of focusing power3
here the ear was first able to detect the greatest
range of vibrations 3 and from each of these points
the animal race goes on into fuller life—so in human
history we see here and there, in different times
and nations‚ characters whose activities are so
steadfastly directly toward right in one or many
fields of activity, that they become centres of
illumination‚ and from each of these lives humanity
goes on into fuller life. We call such men in—

founders of religions. We are bound to believe
that God would impart to each one of these all
the light that each was able to grasp. There are
many thousands of intelligent people who believe
that Jesus Christ was able to direct not some but
