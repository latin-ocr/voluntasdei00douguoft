as time goes on : Moses, Plato, Shakespeare, were
probably as great as our descendants are likely to
be, but the race is producing more men able to
raise their fellows, and in thus improving the social
environment they make it possible for more men

We can get at this idea also in another way.

which produces the best result, is what we have
called the work of the artist in life. We obtained
this conclusion by examining, first, the work of the

and, thirdly, the work of the artist in life. Under

ideals in the humanity around him. Thus, great
men might become artists in things; they would
