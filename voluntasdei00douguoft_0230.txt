how great was the salvation accomplished. Just as,
in the Gospel story, upon the road up to Jerusalem
He pressed before them, just as upon the road at
Emmaus He made as if He would go farther—
just so, with majestic footsteps and ever increasing
union with Divinity, He is always passing on.
There is no stopping-place—there never has been
a stopping—place3 but, looking back, we can see
certain landmarks which suggest the future road
by marking the direction in which the road has
come. For example, looking back to examine the
universe as it appeared to Dante, who mapped out
the physical conceptions that had obtained until
his day, we have what seems to us now a toy
universe. The world is its centre, and the spirit
of man has no kindred with the earth from which
it sprang, but is akin only to God.

We must not regard with disdain‚ or seek to
ignore, the very desperate fight which the Church
made in the hope of retaining the belief that the
world was the centre of the universe, and that the
spirit of man, akin to the divine spirit, did not
stoop to kinship with the rest of creation. It is
shallowness and lack of insight that make us
suppose that the discovery of the insignificant
place of our world in the astronomical universe,
of the intimate kinship that man has, body and
soul, with the whole creative process as we now
know it, ought to make no difference to our con-
ception of the nature of the Christ and to the
interpretation we must give to the doctrines of the
Incarnation and the Atonement if we are still to
hold these. We cannot force an interpretation
