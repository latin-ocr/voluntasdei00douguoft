xv WORLD AFFIRMATION 203

If the Christ was the manifestation of complete
oneness of the divine will and the human will, the
action and passion of the Christ must have been
the manifestation of the eternal action and passion
of the Creator. If God is not reconciling the
whole of His terrestrial creation to His own way,
bringing earthly life into the full expression of the
character He first conceived for it, by suffering in
its waywardness‚ loving it into obedience without
exerting physica] or moral coercion, the doctrine
of the Atonement is to-day inadequate as an ex-
planation of God's attitude toward His whole
living creation of which man is so intimate a part.
But if this is the way in which God deals with
His creatures, it behoves man thus to deal with all
his fellow—creatures‚ realising that the Creator
suffers with them until evil is overcome of good.

It may be objected to this view that all we
have to do, in order to narrow back our ways of
thought to older wayS, is to insist that there is
instilled into men at birth a spirit or personality
which is not the fruition of terrestrial evolution
but something of quite another origin, and that
the manifestation of God in Christ has reference
only to this His more direct and more lofty
creation of human spirits. I think the difficulties
of this view are enormous, as shown by the ana-
lytical ingenuity needed by its learned exponents.
Of course that does not prove it untrue3 the
difficulties for reasonable faith of assimilating new
knowledge must always be enormous3 but the
real question is whether this compromise with
science does not create more difficulties than it
