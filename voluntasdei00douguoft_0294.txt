ing that all creation is, within its limits, free, and
that it is only learning to conform to God's will as

Thus it becomes impossible to believe that God
regards pain as punishment, or ordains punishment.
But punishment exists in the numbing degeneracy
that overtakes the life that is not warned by pain

a part in a machine become warped or rough it
must be taken out and replaced if the machine is
to continue its work ; and in the development of
life the degenerate strains must die out or progress
would cease. We have seen in the fanciful illus—
