xvm CHRISTIAN UNITY 245

People naturally group themselves round leaders
of thought; the groupings become hereditary;
the central thought of the group becomes but—
tressed by ideas which harmonise with it, and thus
a body of opinion grows with the growth of the
party or sect. Religious controversy is always
concerned with the honour of God. Each side is,
in its own estimation, the “host of the Lord,‘'
contending for His truth, His person, His govern-
nient, as for a divine banner.

Mr. Balfour has lately said that religion con-
sists in the belief that God takes sides in the world.
We must conceive of God as taking the part of
right against wrong, not of man against man;
for it is worthy of note that, while all religious
differences involve each party believing that God
is with them and against their opponents, the un-
biased observer, removed from the heat of contro-
versy, can often see a higher right in which both
conceptions of right so bitterly fought for have
their share.

It is evident that the Kingdom of God, with
whose advent Jesus identified His own future,
must be the right with which God fully identifies
Himself, manifested in our concrete life; and
although, while the Kingdom tardes, we can only
see this divine ideal less and less dimly, never
clearly, the historic life of Jesus must be the germ
of the righteousness that will subsume the differ-
ences of faithful men Our knowledge of it must
be the searchlight by which we may examine the
complexity of things to discover, as nearly as we

may, God’ s side.
