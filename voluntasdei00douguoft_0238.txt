holy joy that are blazing everywhere in heart and
hearth‚ easy as it is for all of us to imagine a past,
or a present, or a future of terrestrial conditions
which has no reality, and form obstinate theories
on the basis of such imagination, as Christians we
must gird up the loins of our minds and think
soberly of the coming of that Kingdom in which
God's will is to be done on earth.

Either God in Christ has not set His hand to
the plough of a triumphant terrestrial evolution,
or, having done so, He will not turn back. If
all the change in earthly conditions since the
earliest geological period be a chance, an accident,
or if we can trace no improvement in these con-
ditions, if life and love are not better than the
dust‚ then we are at liberty to believe that our
salvation is only a question of the disentanglement
of spirit from the world of sense. ssut if the
Incarnation and the Atonement have any signifi—
cance in interpreting this process of evolution‚ if
they be indeed the revelation that divine Spirit
seeks no such disentanglement but seeks rather
closer union with sensuous creation, we are driven
gladly to believe that every human institution,
every department of earthly life, is to be made
wholesome and helpful to the perfecting of the
whole.
