CHAPTER XIX

PAIN AND PUNISHMENT

I THINK we shall all admit that capacity for suf—
fering—i. e. pain of any sort—only exists with the
development of consciousness, and only according
to the degree in which consciousness is developed.
But below the stage of consciousness we see that
When there is any deviation from the normal, either
in the living thing or in its environment‚ processes
of failure set in, producing either premature death
or deformity or disease. An unhealthy tree may
be stunted in its youth and deformed by blight
and fungi. In conscious life exactly the same
thing happens, and produces physica] pain. In
intelligent life we have two distinct Varieties of
failure, one of which we call moral and the other
mental, as well as the physica] which we share
with the animals and plante. Where there is
failure life may be transmitted, but it is to some
degree a degenerate life.

To me it seems that all this points to the fact
that there are two directions in which life can travel:
the one leads on in the direction of its first impulse,
and through higher development to development
