*CHAPTER Xiv

THE UNIVERSAL WEAL

The universal weal is the weal of God.

We can only think of God positively in relation to our universe, as the
source of its energy, the architect of its progress‚ the sharer of its su ffering,
the ruler of its perfected condition, revealed through a human life per-
fectly at one with Himself‚ as the sun is reve-almi through its photospherc.

The goal of God must be also the goal of man. With God he must
co-operate, first to attune his mind and will to God‘s, and then to list
humanity and all creation to perfection.

How can we conceive that universal perfection?

The universe being the outcome of one purpose we conceive all its parts and
their perfection as interdependent.

Similarly, confining ourselves to our own world and all it contains, we must
realise that the most insignificant plant or animal, though it may not
directly serve humanity, must subserve the all-embracing purpose of God
in some way.

For if God could disregard His lower creations when man carne forth, He
could disregard man if in some other world a higher race were evolved.
Hence humanity can only feel assured of salvation because of the saith that

God wills the salvation of the whole.

Thus the argument for man‘s salvation founded on the idea of the earth as
the centre of the universe, and man as its supreme product‚ must give way
to an argument consonant with the idea of the relative insignificance of
our earth in the universe, and of man’s life upon it. That argument must
be the universality of God’s purpose as embracing the least of His creatures‚
and a consummation of that purpose which we do not see on earth, in
which every class of life must have its part, for if any part of the universe
can be Godless‚ the whole may be.

Our Lord taught emphatically that nothing lives or dies without God.

The universality of the divine purpose will only overwhelm and confuse our
thought unless, with Jesus Christ, we centre attention on its fatherliness‚
involving as it does a consummation that will fulfil the promise of all
things.

Such vision of God's end, though we can only see it in blurred outline, can
help us to the rejecting of paltry ideas of God’s Church and His heaven,
and to some hint of reconciliation between the world-affirming and the
world-negating spirit.

The universal perfection, in which consists the weal of God‚ must always be
the goal of the extra-regarding purpose of corporate humanity.
