SYNOPSIS xiii

{kuni
As death and desuetudo of ideas attach to any divine purpose we
can detect here, we are driven to produce the line of hope beyond
this world, towards a synthesis of individual and racial im-

mortality.

CHAPTER V

EMERGENCE or Rfflmous L1FE . . . . . 65

As the senses emerge in biological evolution‚ the psychic qualities
connected with them also evolve. By the same process we see
man's consciousness of God evolve within his self-consciousness.

Animal sympathy produces altruism—e.g. mother and young3 dog
and master. In the same way human sympathy with God pro-
duces susceptibility to divine influence.

God-consciousness described in Holy Writ in terms of physical con-
sc1ousness.

No line can be drawn between man's psychic and spiritual powerS.

CHAPTER VI

Umor< oe Gon wiTH CREATION. . . . . 77

As the line of tendency in evolution passes through intelligence
to consciousness of God and the immortal hope, it points to a
destiny that is union with God.

Eternal truth can only be apprehended by a variety of analogies.

The idea of union thus considered. Plant and seedling. Animal and
offspring. In the union of herd‚ hive, flock, unity of purpose
is added to unity of kind. Greater difference goes with closer
union, as in unity of marriage3 unity of understanding.

Difference‚ personality, self-hood‚ are necessary to a high degree
of unity. We have no conception of real unity that does not
depend on difference.

Four sorts of unity—of kind, of purpose, of feeling, of interpreta-
tion. All these exemplified in the brief hour of family life.

But man seeks an abiding union on these lines. Hence-—

1. Ancestor worship—identifying kindred with God.

2. Tribal gods—deifying the corporate purpose.

3. Mystery religions, involving unity of feeling—deifying
the intuitions of the race.

4. Philosophies, involving unity of interpretation—deifying
intellectual conceptionS.

The religion which can satisfy humanity must offer all these sorts
of unity in one, and the unity must be between different persons
—man and God.

It is this to which nature unconsciously tends. It is this which
man consciously seeks. It is in this search that God meets
man bestowing re-creative love.
