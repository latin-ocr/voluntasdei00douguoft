CHAPTER XIII

THE WEAL OF SPECIES OR RACE

Perfection of the individual in isolation does not satisfy us, for if all things
fulfil one purpose, variety must end in vital unity, and individual perfection
involve perfection of the universe. As a stage toward this is involved the
perfection of the race.

The individual‚ both in this life and in the next, must be in relation with the
life of the whole, for out of all relation he would cease to exist.

Analogy to the constitution of the physical universe, any member of which,
if it could get outside the range of gravitation‚ etc„ would, so far as we
know, cease to exist as an individual.

Attraction of man for man is analogous to the attraction of physical particle
for particle.

The self that would isolate itself from the influence of all other selves is
more liable to disintegrate than the self that is governed entirely by the
spirit of age or class.

God's purpose for humanity on earth and beyond being one purpose, the
unity of the race on earth must be perpetuated beyond death, human
beings always, everywhere, co-operating with God to accomplish His pur-
pose, or, possibly, (lefying that purpose to their own spiritual disintegration.
