Yet we perceive growth; his execution becomes
better by practice, his choice more artistic. It is
urged, on this hypothesis, that there is no evidence
that he constructed the piano or composed the
music, and that therefore a greater mind than his,
with larger power of choice‚ must be assumed as
the first cause of both.

Fully granting the inadequacy of the analogy‚
I want to use it for pointing out some facts con-

The first hypothesis, known as “ naturalism,‘'
like worn-out gear passing from rich to poor, has
descended from the schools to the workshop, and
we may fail to give full weight to the fact that
it is a perfectly consistent whole, and not to be
taken as merely satisfactory in parts. If any one
can conceive that in the very beginning the piano
could begin to be of its own potentiality‚ Ι think
that they ought to have no more difficulty in
assuming that the most splendid passages of the
music could be originated entirely by the motions
