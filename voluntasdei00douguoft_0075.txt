CHAPTER III

PROVIDENCE AND AUTONOMY'

Can we detect in world evolution a purpose which tallies with the types of
purpose we have found in man?

The order we perceive in inorganic nature tallies with such human purpose
as we have called mechanical.

In the earliest stage of life physical strength and adaptation seem to be
the aim.

Later on the aim seems to be a balance of physical force and intelligence5
not the strongest body, nor the strongest intelligence, but the best com-
bination of these persists. We therefore get defects in the physical
nature and in intelligence handed down along the line of fullest life.

Later, when what we call God-consciousness or spiritual life is added, nature
again strives for a balance of the three qualities3 again defects in each
aspect are handed down along the line of fullest life.

The purpose suggested by the development of human life is health of body
and brain, excellence of intelligence, excellence of will power, excellence
of the extra-regarding impulses which make for the perfectiori of corporate
life. The prevailing desire of nature seems to be to rid itself of defects in
all these.

The disease germ or parasite does not belong to the method, but militates
against the purpose.

If this tendency to excellence of life indicates God⁷s will, very much must
happen in our universe which merely represents the will of the autonomous
creature before it is won by the persuasive purpose of God.

If disease and defect were the will of God, God and the life-force would be
at war.

But on what grounds do we claim that all that happens—including disease
and defect—is “ providential ''?

Going back to what in man we saw to be the highest sort of purpose, we
find that the teaching and training of autonomous life cannot mean the
ordering of all its joys and sorrows.

We therefore assume that the supreme purpose of the universe may only be

accomplished when the creature co-operates with the life-force, i.e. with
God.
