10 VOLUNTAS DEI

and it hung over the other, making it useless as a
table. Their faith in divine providence as related
to funguses did not survive the knowledge that
such ledges grew, like everything else in the wood,
that they were as liable to be inconvenient as con-
venient, and that the farmer said they were caused
by a disease in the tree. The very word “ disease '’
and the blood-red colour made the whole loath-
some to them. Here, then, were these little
worshippers of nature as the manifestation of
divine purpose, suddenly plunged into the belief
that they played amid a system of sels-evolving
accidents‚ where beauty might be thought of as
consisting solely in their own power of admiration,
their own power of adapting accidents to their
convenience.

Let us now take the wood and its funguses as
standing for our universe, and let the children
represent our theorists. Again the analogy is
inadequate; again I merely use it in order to
make remarks on a difficult subject with some
clarity. Those who maintain the hypothesis of
God as the origin and controller of our universe
must, if they are thinkers, perceive clearly that
in the ordered growth of things death and decay
are a part of the whole economy of the wood. It
is, in fact, quite impossible to conceive of a wood
without death and decay as well as growth, and it
is impossible to think of death and decay without
large opportunity of parasitic growths, beautiful
and ugly, which might have been healthy forms of

their type of life, but have become the disease of
a higher form of life.
