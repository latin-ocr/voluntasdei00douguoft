vices St. Paul lists as the opposites of these virtues,
and we shall at once see that they do not tend to
fulness of life. Whenever these virtues are pre-
eminently present, can we question that the child
born of them and to them is pre-eminently “ born
of God ''? If, then, we find in history a character
which in a unique sense “cannot commit sin,”
He must be above all others the most direct result
of God's creative will, of the brooding or over-
shadowing of the Spirit which is God Most High.

Whether, then, the story of the Virgin Birth
relate fact or relate a poetic interpretation of truth‚
the idea it expresses is still true. If our whole
hypothesis of creative purpose represent reality,
if the Creator always unites With His free creation
just in so far as the creature's autonomy is used
aright; in the creative process going on through
all the ages, whenever and wherever creation is at
its best, there the creative purpose of the Most
High is specially at work. And this special
creative action must generate the life of great and
good rnen just as truly as it upholds thern all
their lives, If we believe our Lord to have been
the perfect will of humanity, the completed type
of free-will-—the will that all moral men had sought
to exercise and could not, we must know that
He could have come of no ordinary earthly stock,
and that His life was pre-eminently generated, as
it was pre-eminently upheld, by the power of the
Most High.

The transcendent truth of the divine Sonship is
that creation was with God from all time, came from
God, is in part turning of its own will toward God,
