and adaptation come from within. Within an
animal also, and within a man, the same will be
true. Are we not all more or less familiar with
the idea that we have a deep well to draw from,
a well of life that is not our own proper life till
we take it into ourselves and use it? When we
find ourselves in communion with divine Spirit we
know for the first time, and ever more clearly, that
it is the self that is limited, not the life that wells
up within, and in more conscious communion with
God we may learn to transcend our ordinary powers
of assimilating life, and by degrees to transcend
them habitually.

We all draw on this common fund of life.
The new Pantheism calls it God ; but that is
absurd unless we would be irreligious 3 for by this
common life we think our worst thoughts as well
as our best ; evil grows more evil at the same rate,
but not under the same persuasion, as good grows
more good. We must regard “ evil ’‘ as denoting
any deviation from the most wholesome, and there-
fore fullest, life. Every such deviation‚ unless
arrested by re-creative Influence, leads to loss of
joy, loss of function, perhaps ultimate return, in
latent form, to the common stream of life. In
this we touch the nursery walls within which created
life is being trained by God to form with Himself
a new unity‚ and we are bound to believe that all
effort for what is normal, good and joyous, is met
by the re-creative power of God.
