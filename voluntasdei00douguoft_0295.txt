form of plant life, that he must at the very outset
not only limit it by giving it character, but
determine that its failures must prove sterile in
order that its various forms of beauty may have a
chance to become excellent. If we produce this
thought into the sphere of mind or spirit, regard—
ing our personalities as individualised mind, we
must suppose that the result of wrongdoing must
take the shape of sterility of heart and, possibly,
gradual disintegration of the individual.

We may hope that this is impossible to humanity,
that salvation shall be all—embracing, but we must
admit that neither from the tenor of our Lord’s
teaching nor from the course of affairs in the world
have we any such assurance. But our belief in
creative purpose makes it necessary to believe that
the final extinction of the individual mind, if it
takes place, would be re-absorption into the created
life-force to rise again through personality to
union with God.

As things are, all mankind on earth, even the
most degraded, have an opportunity, by embracing
the regenerative sympathy of God, to return
to the normal onward path. The return is to
be accomplished by faith in God's re-creation,
and the result would be the continued integrity
of the individual mind, or, as our Lord is repre-
sented as saying, the sels-possession of the soul.
Ι do not think there exists any human being, how-
ever apparently degenerate, to whom this faith
could not be imparted by the energy and sym-
pathetic faith of noble souls, if this energy were
rightly directed.
