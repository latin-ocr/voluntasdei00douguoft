served God and man in this first way, and so has
every inanimate and animate thing. To regard
it as the human ideal is to refuse to recognlse
any ascending scale in the quality of life. It
is only 1n a society of men who seek the social
weal first that the best social advantages can be
“added t0‚‘' or experienced by, the individual.
Man is essentially social, but he must first be
ideally social before he can experience the idea]
social advantage.

It would be necessary, then, as men become
attuned to the perfect environment, that they
should develop this temper—the temper that
indicates the method of progressive life—(1) ready
to yield and give themselves without recompense ;
(2) ready to dare all things, full of enterprise3
(3) ready to set the corporate weal first among
the motives of life, recognising that only thus
can any man attain to what all men truly desire.

The review of the evolutionary process finally
leads us, through plant and animal life, and beyond
what we may call the necessity of man's social
nature manward‚ to the exercise of his social
nature Godward. For we see in history that the
pulse of fullest life, of greatest progress, beats only
in the warmth and heat of an altar fire which
expresses his conception of, and relation to, God.
I think it will be found that corporate humanity
has always flourished best under the notion that
Deity was very closely allied to humanity. Wher-
ever invisible Deity is not conceived of as suffering,
wherever man ceases to identify God with human
weal, wherever man conceives that he cannot hurt
