CHAPTER II

CREATIVE PURPOSE

When increasing knowledge shatters the traditional pictures of the unknown
it is better to build these up again rather than seek to live by a saith
unaided by imaginaffion, always bearing in mind that all words and images
are merely symbols of truth.

Assuming God as first cause, we must try to picture His relation to creation.

Metaphysical difficulties notwithstanding, we postulate Creator and mention,
and must paint the unknown in analogies from the life we know.

Matter, whether organic or inmganic, is now described in a way that to the
plain man implies that it is only a form of energy. Energy may be
thought of as the body of life. Let us picture how this creation can have
come to be.

We may conceive of creation as the gift of life.
Autonomy is of the essence of life3 for since we insist that man is sels-

direcdng, spite of scientific evidence that he is determined, we need not
suppose all other things entirely different from him in this respect.

In the beginning we get motion, tension, attraction‚ repulsion‚ and by degrees
what we call the “inanimam’' universe—God exercising in this stage
something analogous to mechanical purpose.

When life begins to express itself in organic forms, autonomy becomes more
decided 3 God's purpose works more intricately.

Along the line of intelllgent life we get greater and greater autonomy, which
at last calls sor what we know as the highest form of purpose—that of the
parent or teacher.

Pantheistic thought identifies the life of the universe with God3 but life
lends itself both to good and evil, to progress and retrogression. It appears
saner to regard life as the not-God, which came from God, and is being
trained by Him to form with Himself a new unity.

It is never life that is limited, but the power of the organism to utilise life
for its own ends. The perfectiori of the organism would be its power to
utilise life fully for its highest end.

When life at last in man becomes conscious of itself, and able consciously to
respond to God, we get “spiritual life‚’' which entails pre-eminently the
power to utilise more and more of the universal life for the highest end.

The speculations of this chapter seem to harmonise with experience.
