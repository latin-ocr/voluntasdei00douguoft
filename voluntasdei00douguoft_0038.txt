6 VOLUNTAS DEI

necessary to keep in mind that the most elaborate
study of the piano, from which we might deduce
all the powers of wood and steel, the most ex-
haustive study of the music, from which the whole
science of harmony could be built up, the experi—
ence of all the emotion and thought which the
music could arouse, could never lead one any
nearer to the discovery of the invisible operator
unless some material connecting wire could be
discovered between the piano and the next room.
If, for example, the piano were played by some
process analogous to wireless telegraphy, successive
generations of ignorant spectators could waste
themselves in studying the mere piano and the
mere music ; it would require the fetch of faith to
assume the operator.

Then, with regard to the second hypothesiS,
it likewise can be camade to explain all the facts as
well as it can explain the least of them. According
to this theory, there is an unseen operator pressing
buttons who is the cause of the movements in the
piano and of the whole nature and quality of the
music, and was, farther back, the cause of the suc-
cessive changes in matter which constructed the
piano. The fact that his power of execution and
choice are now observed to be imperfect, because
still improving, does not alter the fact that he is the
only cause to be seen which could have constructed
the piano and the music. If, then, we are forced
by our unwillingness to assume unnecessary multi—
plicity of causes, to rule out any other maker of
the piano or composer of the music, the fact of the
obvious improvement in the music will not alter
