SYNOPSIS xvii

luxuri

To get our simplest conception of creation let us imagine a garde-ner
creating a rose. He must exhibit, first, power to conceive the
rose character. His conception must extend to all possible
varieties of the rose life.

At thc same time, to form the conception is to set its limits.

These limits are twofold—the outwartl and visible possibilstics,
and the character of the inner secret life.

1f we attribute to such a life any power of self-‹lirection, it follows
that the creator-gardener cannot know which possibility will
develop and which will fail. His power, after creation, will be
of the same nature as that of the adult over the child.

In both cases higher power is strictly regulated in relation to
inferior power, its secret being the ability to conceive an end and
regulate action toward that end.

Hence this must be our conception of Omnipotence.

The creation of the finite must therefore involve the sels-regulation
of the Infinite.

If so, how can we assume we understand the degree of self-limita-
tion ?

If the end Omnipotence has in view is a form of created life able
to freely co-operate with Him, that would seem to involve
limiting Himself so far as to give the ability to resist Him.

This resistance in lower nature would mean disease and degenera-
tion; in higher nature, these together with moral disease and
moral degeneration.

But it is only the possibility of resistance, not resistance itself, that
can be said to be necessary.

We cannot conceive of Omnipotence as able to have all things that
seem to us good. Foreknowledge appears to us good, but the
supreme good appears to us to be the hope of something better
than we have ever experienced.

We cannot conceive God as both having all things at once and as
having this supreme joy of expectation. We should remember
this when inclined to dogmatise as to what Omnipotence must
or must not include.

It appears, however, to require a greater degree of power to create
a living existence whose successive attainments would be an ever-
varying and glad surprise to the Creative Mind than to create a
passive thing whose career would be from the beginning static
to the Creative Mind.

The Christian will here remember that our Lord represented God
as a Father‚ and thus gave His authority to the idea that God's
happiness is concerned in the choices that men make.

The responsibility felt by the best parents for the careers of their
children is something that perhaps comes as near to touchingthe
great Reality as anything we know.

Isso, God’s prescience must extend to all possibilities of disaster,
and against the results of all possible disaster He must provide.
God's re-creating influence on His creatures must be unceasing

though not coercive.
