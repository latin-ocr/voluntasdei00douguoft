relation to humanity. But we have learned that
humanity is only an incident in creation. It
follows that the Incarnation is the manifestation
of how God works in creation, what He is trying
to do for the whole earth. If we could obtain
an adequate answer to this ‘⁶ what '' or “ how '' we
should have, of course, the one true and only
theology. It is evident that we can only have
such an answer as humanity on earth at any given
time is capable of understanding. But if the
Incarnation is really the divine event that the
Church holds it to be, every increase in our know-
ledge ought to bring us an increase of power to
understand, through the Incarnation, what God is
trying to do in creation, and by what method He
is trying to do it.

Just as, in the early Church, men were better
able to understand what God “ taking upon Him '‘
hunianity meant when they realised that Jew and
Greek, savage and alien, master and slave, were
all one ; just as from the fact that on the Gentiles
also was poured out the Spirit they argued the
greatness of the Christ whom at first they had
recognised only as the Jewish Messiah; so from
the fact that we now know ourselves to be only
an incident in the vaster creative process we are
bound to argue that the manifestation of God in
Christ shows God's righteousness as a taking of
responsibility for the whole vast creative process,
as having respect for all the free life He has made,
as having fellowship with all jOy and all suffering
and all sin, and as having eternal patience and love
beyond our utmost stretch of thought.
