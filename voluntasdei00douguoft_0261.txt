CHRISTIAN ENTERPRISE 229

“Thou shalt not.'' Life is a positive outflow
whose character defines its form. It is only in the
artificial that we get beauty by chopping away.
For example, we hear nowadays very much
about the fact that the Church has a higher ideal
of marriage than the world3 marriage with a
deceased wife's sister and marriage of divorced
persons are condemned; but how very little do
we hear from the pulpit of the ideal marriage, of
the positive benefits of the sort of love required
for it, of the joy with which every boy and girl
should look forward to, and prepare for, this
aspect of life l How little do we hear of the ideal
relations that should exist between all men and
women in order that the young may grow up in a
social and economic atmosphere in which this ideal
love may freely develop. To what extent is the
great and riveting theme which enthrals the
young—and all men as long as the heart is young
-in lyric and drama, and is the heart of modern
fiction—to what extent is this theme developed by
the Church into the positive glory of Christian
life? If individual preachers hesitate to approach
this sacred subject it is evidently because they have
not been taught in what way this may and ought
to be done. We cannot suppose that it is beyond
the wisdom of applied theology, beyond the in—
spiration that waits upon the prayer and holy
enterprise of the corporate religious mind, to
devise how it may be done. If all this is not
done the warmest imagery of the youthful heart
is left a fallow field, and in the very centre of living
Christian orthodoxy there is a great sin of omission,
