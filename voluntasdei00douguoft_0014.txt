the facts we know the basis of inference as to the nature of
God’s purpose.

The qualities of purpose considered in concrete life.

1. Purpose exercised between precise forecast and exact fulfil-
ment. This only possible for the mere mechanic work-
ing in inanimate matter.

2. Inventor or artist works out new ideal in inanimate matter.
Forecast less precise 3 result less accurate.

3. Gardeners and herdsmen work out inward ideals in the
material of life. These desire only the perfection of the
life they tend, without forecasting individual variation.

4. The schoolmaster‚ parent, or missionary works out inward
ideals in a higher form of life. The higher the material
in which the purpose must be worked out, the stronger
and nobler must be the purpose.

This is the law of purpose3 and we may infer from it that God
executes His purpose in the sphere of autonomous life, that the
divine Will is not a force that works mechanically between
precise forecast and exact fulfilment.

CREATIVE PURposE . . . . . . . 31

When increasing knowledge shatters the traditional pictores of
the unknown, it is better to build these up again rather than
seek to live by a saith unaided by imagination, always bearing in
mind that all words and images are merely symbols of truth.

Assuming God as first cause, we must try to picture His relation
to creation.

Metaphysical difficulties notwithstanding, we postulate Creator
and creation, and must paint the unknown in analogies from
the life we know.

Manet, whether organic or inorganic, is now described in a way
that to the plain man implies that it is only a form of energy.
Energy may be thought of as the body of life. Let us picture
how this creation can have come to be. ’

We may conceive of creation as the gift of life.

Autonomy is of the essence of life; for since we insist that man
is sels-directing‚ spite ofscientific evidence that he is determined,
we need not suppose all other things entirely different from him
in this respect.

In the beginning we get motion, tension, attraction‚ repulsion, and
by degrees what we call the “ inanimate” universe—God exer-
cising in this stage something analogous to mechanical purpose.

When life begins to express itself in organic forms, autonomy
becomes more decided3 God’s purpose works more intricately.
