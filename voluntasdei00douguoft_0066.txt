use the religious imagination. The powers of the
mind work with one another in unity‚ as do different
human minds in a corporate body, and the greatest,
the imagination, must always be the servant of all.
It is the law of life that the greatest shall serve the
least, and only in obedience to it can anything
worthy be produced.

If we conceive of creative Intelligence as the
first cause, and call that cause God, we are obliged
to form some picture to ourselves of the process
of creation.

I do not think it is possible in metaphysical
thought to conceive of Creator and creation in a
monistic universe—one of the two must be set
aside as an illusion, ButI think belief 1n both
Creator and creation is forced upon us, although it
does not seem possible for human thought in its
present condition to be satisfied with a pluralistic
universe. But it is quite possible that M. Bergson
is right—that what seem to us the necessities of
metaphysica] thought have arisen from the concep—
tions gradually gained by humanity from dealing
with the physical universe as if it were stable. We
are, in the course of ages, coming to know that it
is the stability of things that is the greater illusion,
but, all the same, we are forced to deal with them
as if they were stable. Very likely it is from mil-
lenniums of this practical dealing that what seem
to us the necessities of metaphysical thought have
grown up. Metaphysics apart‚ we must go to life
as we know it for those analogies which can make
any safe foothold for our thought in its dealings
with the unknown.
