xii VOLUNTAS DEI

But on what grounds do we claim that all that happens—including
disease and defect-——is “ providential '' ?

Going back to what in man we saw to be the highest sort of pur-
pose, we find that the teaching and trainin‘g of autonomous life
cannot mean the ordering of all its joys and sorrows.

We therefore assume that the supreme purpose of the universe may
only be accomplished when the creature co—operates with the
life-force, i.e. with God.

Bearing of this on the doctrine of prayer.

CHAPTER IV

THE Puaposs IN HUMANJTY

Since God gave autonomy to His mention, He must have power
to realise His purpose by that method.

As ‘⁶ faithful Creator ” He must be related to His creation—(l) by
accepting the struggle between right and wrong as His own, (2)
by thus ensuring a compensating gain to creation for all the
suffering entailed by freedom.

We have found that in organic nature the stream of life discards
disease and defect and failure in intelligence, in temperance and
courage, in affection for offspring and co-operation with fellows.

In human affairs progress is more complex. Conscience, or satis-
faction in virtue, seems to belong to the fullest force of human
life. Life—sound, abundant, beautiful—does not flow along the
generations of those who break through customs to gratify
passion: it flows along the generations of the law-abiding,
but also of those who disregard present law in the effort to
mould and obey the higher law of the future.

The push of conscience must be seen not only in the will, but in
the understanding.

Along this line we get the growth of the hope in social progress
or personal immortality, οι· both.

This is exemplified in the history of the human race. Nations
with a religion of pessimism and fear show powers of accurate
observation and vivid imagination 5 but advance in political
justice and social amelioration are only found with those who
hope in the future.

This hope develops intellect. Thus, intellectual as well as moral
force is found necessary to fulness of life. A hopeful intellectual
life makes for universal fellowship. Monopolies always yield
to the advance of a fuller life.

Perfection of conscious life is to be manifested in physical health
and beauty, mental genius and social love.

But the individual dies imperfect.

The perfect fulfilment of every individual life seems involved in
any purpose of the universe worthy to be called divine.
