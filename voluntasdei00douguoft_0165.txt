x OMNIPOTENCE 133

the spontaneity of racial life is the great delusion,
that humanity in its relation to (iod is a mere
thing. But in this figure, as in my figures, God
is working to a definite, preconceived end which
must regulate His action.

The creation of the finite must therefore mean
the self-regulation of the Infinite. The power
