276 VOLUNTAS DEI emp, xx

giving winds of God and beams of joy that
destroy our myriad germs of death. In the
Christian salvation the word “G0d” shall in—
creasingly become to humanity the synonym for all
joy. Heasth, genius, beauty‚ and love shall well
up in each beart at the blessed Name, and all men
shall instinctively turn to high empmse.

In our appropriation of Christ, by His saith
welling up in υς, we shall leam ever more clearly
that as the shadow of a lark is to the flood of light
in which it rises singing toward the sun, so is the
sum of pain in creation, and God's suffering for
creation, in comparison with the joy of a free,
regenerate creation united to the JOy of God.
