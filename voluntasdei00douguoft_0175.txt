Source of the developing life is indicated by
the quality of its development—physical energy
into life, life into self—hood ; that is, we seem bound
to believe that sels—hood approaches nearer to the
nature of the Source.

Illegitimate anthropomorphism seems to me to
consist in assuming that what we know as self-
hood does not require a series of further and
greater developments before we can understand
the absolute nature of the Source of our being.¹
The fact that we may be still in an embryonic
stage, many degrees removed from understanding
God's nature, is what makes the Incarnation a
belief of such vast importance. And if we analyse
the dim vision of a Supreme Power manifested in
the creative process, we may see reason to regard
the personality and the tragedy of Jesus Christ as
the natural manifestation of the action of that
Power toward us,

If the life of Jesus was the manifestation of
perfect human volition‚ if God's will therefore
came into perfect union with the will of Jesus,
what would naturally be the revelation of the
divine will in its complete union with human will?

We confuse the subject of revelation when we
suppose that it must necessarily enter into human
life through the gate of the reason only, although
perhaps we confuse it more if we suppose that it
can enter into human life without the co-operation

plhysical universe, giving our spirits an entirely different origin, leads to
