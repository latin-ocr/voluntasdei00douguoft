CHAPTER VII

NEWNESS OF LIFE

Susceptibility to God's influence develops with the growing God—conscious-
ness.

Illustration—the sea breaking into a new inlet.

Communion of God and man may be described as “telepathic.''

Union of man with God does not mean identity. True union depends on
community of kind and difference of identity.

We rarely see anything perfect after its kind. Degree of perfection in plants
or animals depends on environment. Whatever the general level reached
by a class or species, it will respond to an improved environment.

So with the human race. Hence the fonction of the most God-conscious
man must be to better the social environment of his fellows.

To describe this function in another way: the highest human work is creative,
and the highest material for this work is conscious autonomous life, and
the highest product is a new humanity. The greatest men will, there-
fore, always be working to create new rnen and a new human environment.

Thus the greatest men have been founders of world religions which, in pro-
portion to their greatness‚ transcend local and national barriers.

But while any society is still imperfect, human excellence, which must be
God's intention, cannot be perfectly realised in it.

The highest development possible to the individual in an imperfect environ-
ment can only be perfection of volition.

When this is attained by the founder of a religion the result must be a
society that will transcend all human distinctions.
