knowledge for the creature is to understand the
aim of the Creator, and by what method it is
accomplished3 and this knowledge when gained
will naturally work on the creature in two ways z
first, showing him that his own highest work must
be in imitation of the Creator; and, secondly,
strengthening him to endure the hardship of his
task by knowledge of the Creator's sympathetic
suffering and sustaining power, which ensures
ultimate success. Thus we see the inspiration of
our Lord's proclamation of the future perfecting
of our life and its conditions.

It would, then, certainly seem necessary that
the human life that in its volitional aspect is
absolutely at one with the divine should have
impressed itself outwardly upon the world as
having this character—a character willing toward
men God's own servanthood, and His own agony
for men, and His own regal certainty that He
would win men, and requiring His disciples to
carry on His work in the same spirit. Thus we
see the inspiration of our Lord's teaching concern—
ing the taking up of the cross.

The more we ponder the dealing of the Creator
with free, self—conscious mind, the more we come
to believe that it is as the individual becomes a
voluntary part of a larger psychic organism, and
subserves the whole, that he rises toward God.
This seems so as a fact of history, and we can see
that it must be so because, as intelligence develops
and the body becomes less dependent upon any
particular physical environment, the life becomes
more dependent upon the psychic environment,
