ceases to be capable of great desire for conscious
union. If devils had such a desire, like Milton‘s
bad angels, they would not be devils at all. We

nature ever to degenerate in immortal life beyond
recovery, but I have introduced this hypothetical
union of devils to illustrate two things : first, that
free and conscious spirits must be in union with those
of their own class because they emit the same im·-
pulses and are sensitive only to the same waves of
energy, and I would call attention to the fact that
this 1s the least degree of unity of which humanity
is capable; secondly‚ that because we cannot con-

this, we find it impossible to conceive of dis-
tinctions among them ; by the analogy of all
things we know we must believe that devilishness
would tend to sameness of nature, and to freak
rather than purpose in activity.1
