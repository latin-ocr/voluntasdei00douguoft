in beautiful objects disappoints the expectation of
beauty. There are few things more beautiful in
form than a calla lily against its own leaf, or
a few of them grouped in their foliage3 but
a hedge or field of calla lilies strikes one as
merely a coarse form of vegetation, because the
beauty lying in the form of the individual flower
is wholly lost in profusion. Groups of flowering
azaleas are very beautiful on the hillsides of the
English Lake district ; but if we go to the hillsides
of North Carolina, where mountains and valleys
and plains are all on a much larger scale, tracts of
flowering azaleas which may be measured by the
mile rather than the yard are much less beautiful.
Such great masses of colour, in which light and
shade are indistinguishably blended, weary the eye.
It may be urged that if we were larger and our
eyes stronger we should prefer our beautiful objects
of larger size and in larger quantity3 all we can
reply is that, with our capacities and powers limited
as they are, it does not follow in our experience
that because a thing is good it would be better if
it were larger or if there were more of it. The
monsters of the slime gave place to creatures very
like them in character, but smaller and more
effective; the decrease in bulk was not a retro-
gression. And the same sort of considerations
may be applied to prove the necessary limitation
of variation in the other variable characteristics.
We may assume, then, that perfection of rose-life
would be limited in size and quantity, in form,
smell, and colou1·‚ by its own character, i.e. by the
concept of the creator.
