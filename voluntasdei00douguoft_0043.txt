INTRODUCTION 1 1

Again, it is necessary to note that sudden
occurrences which look like magic, which are of
the most extraordinary beauty and convenience,
and other occurrences which have the most dis-
gusting appearance and are merely obstructions to
the working of other things, occur within the
range of the same laws, as do all those things
which by their constant occurrence have become
familiar. It is only ignorance——lack of the know-
ledge within our reach and lack of reflection on
that knowledge—that could make any theorist
think otherwise. If we find the creative power
of God to be for us on the whole the most satis-
factory account of the origin of the wood, we must
ascribe all that belongs to its economy, all the
opportunity it offers to disease and defect, to the
same power. (Ι use the word “God’' here as
equivalent to creative mind and will.)

Those who do and those who do not hold the
hypothesis of God alike must admit that the most
thorough study of the wood makes two points
evident: first, that its most futile and unex-

the wood one hour in advance. Here, then, urge
those who oppose naturalism, we have something
of which the words law, force, matter, accident,

spontaneity; we have perpetually before us a
future which exists not until it is falling into the
