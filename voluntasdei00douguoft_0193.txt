tinues to increase, and two other green projections
come out of it, and then, in that dry place where
the drenching light almost obliterates colour, there
suddenly breaks from one of the hard, green, dry
projections a splendid and delicate scarlet blossom,
and that again withers 3 and then again, for another
year, the green projections grow upward and in—
crease. Now, all the time the sand about it is
never still ; the desert winds arrange it in furrows
or in eddying drifts‚ or in some other form,
continually altering the arrangement, and certain
transmutations are going on by which portions of
every grain of sand are passing away in the hot,
dry air, and uniting with other substances in
different chemical combinations. We cannot be
sure that in any of them nature actually repeats
herself, but the sand behaves merely in obedience
to the forces that play upon it, whereas the
obedience of the cactus to the law of its life is
something which to common human sense appears
much more positive. It is something which
has a power of developing and reproducing the
forms of its own development, so that when the
body of the cactus dies and falls back to the level
of the desert, as the sand ridges do, things are
not as they may have been before the cactus lived 3
for there are several new cactus plants that could
not have been there without the parent plant.
The law of the sand ridges is that they rise and
fall and rise again, and although some change
that affects the whole universe is thus produced,
their rising and falling cannot be said to make
