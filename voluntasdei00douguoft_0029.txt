SYNOPSIS

Analysis of the nature of the unity possible to persons.

Illustrated in the low form of unity possible to devils—Le. the un-
conscious and involuntary unity of centres of a common life,
which all receive and emit similar impulses. The devil,
being degent-rate, tends to greater sameness with his fellows and
to incapacity for conscious union.

All Christians necessarily have the lower degree of involuntary
and unconscious union with each other, for they receive and
transmit similar impulses; but the higher degree of nnion, con-
scious and voluntary, with some outward organisation‚ is neces-
sary for efficiency.

The Christian life tcnds to ever greater variety and ever closer
union.

Christendom has always recognised need of union.

Three epochs in history of Christendom—

(a) That of embryonic and unrecognised divergence.
(b) That of the use of constraint to suppress divergence.
(c) That of recognised divergence and lack of voluntary nnion.

The achievement of voluntary union with adequate scope for
variety still lies before the Church.

‘⁶ The things of God ” thus demanding the greatest distinction and
closest union in men, we may find an explanation of Christian
disunion in our mistaken conception of “the things of God'’
for which religious parties fight.

Looking impartially, we can usually see that in such controversy
God is on both sides, while He can only identify himself fully
with that divine ideal of right embodied in the life of Jesus and
with the coming Kingdom which is its fulfilment.

In so far as we can discover and praetise the righteousness that
belongs to that Kingdom we shall realise the real unity in
diversity of all faithful men.

Misinterpreting “the things of G0d,‘’ we have missed the signifi-
cance of the Cross, not seeing that to suffer with the world has
always been the glory of God.

A religion and civilisation concentrated on the defence ofa good
already attained were bound to be opposed to a forward-looking
Christ.

Peter, wishing earthly power and honour for his Lord, was in

effect desiring to see Him take sides in the current clash of right
and wrong.

Jesus stood for the saith that the taint of evil was over all the
current world, that hope lay in the coming of the perfect reign

‹iti-GT. hIn compelling His crucifixion He attested this faith by
is eat .

We are therefore bound to believe that God sides with an ideal
righteousness just beyond our sight, which all men alike fail to
reach, whence the folly of judgrnent and condemnation among
men is evident3 we see also that God shows Himself in Jesus
as abiding most with those who suffer most under His own gift
of freedom, those who are condemned and outcast by a world
itself condemned by God but not cast out from God,
