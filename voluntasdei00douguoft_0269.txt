then, we are to believe that God is a faithful
Creator, that He is the instructor of men in all
their aspirations‚ that He taught them to aspire
as an eagle teaches its young, stirring up the nest
and casting them out, hovering over thern on the
watch, swooping under to bear thern up when
they fall-if this is our conception of God we
shall be safe, I think, in believing that that which
the world—soul in its aspiration constantly esteems
to be essential to human salvation is essential to it.
I believe that the activities of the Jesus of the
Gospel story are the activities of God in the world,
and that just in so far as men engage in them they
are inspired and inwrought by God in Christ, but
I do not believe that anything actually happened
to our Lord, or by His power, which is not a
promise for the future condition and power of
mankind.

To make men fit for the coming Kingdom
their bodies and minds must march together in a
common progress, and the mental and physical
environment must be that which responds to the
progressive life. Salvation is never static, never
uniform3 it is the progressive revelation of God
who in His relation to creation is the force that
makes for exuberance of life.
