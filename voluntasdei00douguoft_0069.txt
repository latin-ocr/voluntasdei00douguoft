11 CREATIVE PURPOSE 37

God must give. Gift requires giver, receiver, and
somewhat given. But we are thinking of nothing
but God and creation, so the receiver and what
was received vvere one. The divine Generosity
would not give less than life. Giving life to
itself involved giving the germ of freedom—of
will, with life. We are now thinking of the very
essence of this material universe—that Which fills
it to overflowing in its interstellar spaces, in its
every atom of‘ ‘inanimate '’ matter, in its every
pore and cell—as life, life that clothes itself in
energy as a body, life beautiful and abundant,
unceasing in its activity, possessing its ovvn auto-—
nomy; but in all its primal stages, in all its
elements and beginnings, impersonal, unconscious,
having only the first degree of blind autonomy.

We too easily think of man as by nature
different from the rest of creation. Hovvever
irrational the conviction, we are most of us
entirely convinced that in human life, law-*what-
ever it is that we call natural law—is only the
garment of spontaneity ; and Why should we sup-
pose, contrary to all evidence, that nature takes so
large 3 leap as to make man different in this respect
from all else? The evidence and arguments for
determinism seem to me to be conclusive, yet the
fruition of human life breaks forth from the con-
viction that the human will is free. We insist
that man is free, though, as far as experimental
science can teach, we learn that all man is and does
is determined : can we, then, deny freedom to other
things in our universe merely because they seem to
be determined?
