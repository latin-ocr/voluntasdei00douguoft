CHAPTER XII

INDIVIDUAL WEAL

WE have seen everywhere the individual man
seems to be imperfect, but with a sense of irnper-
fection that is a pledge of progress.

We see, however, little evidence of steady pro-
gress in the whole world around us, because indi-
viduals of any species are better or worse according
to environment, and the environment fluctuateS.
A perfect environment is required for a perfect life.

In man it is the sense ofimperfection in physique,
understanding, artistic achievement‚ and in moral
worth, which is the pledge of ultimate perfection.
It is worthy of note that only in regard to this last
point does he feel that his failure is due to his own
lack of effort3 while it is in regard to this one
point that our records emphasise the perfection of
Christ. The Christ proclaimed the advent of a
new environment‚ the perfect environment which
we have seen was needed for the perfection of the
individua13 but also proclaimed that only those
who are fit for the environment could enter it.
We have here the paradox that makes the escha-
tology of our Lord so baffling.
