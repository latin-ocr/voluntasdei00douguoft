that when He would not conform He could
not be good. The goodness of Jesus was a fact
which their interpretation of religion could not
explain3 in order to ignore it they called it
wickedness. In this they were acting a part, just
as any doctrinaire acts a part when out of loyalty
to his doctrine he thrusts aside whatever seems to
controvert it, insisting that it must be evil.

We must suppose that since the world began
there has been but one inward and spiritual faith,
which in each of its various stages has found many
outward and visible expressions, and no doubt in
each stage there has been a measure oftruth mixed in
its expression with much that was fantastic‚ as though
a man half-blind should see in the spiritual world
men as trees walking. And the truth of one stage
has been incorporated into the larger truth of the
next. This process must be always going on, but
by such fine gradations that the human eye can
only detect the process when some unusually strong
personality voices the advance. If the drama of
the historic life of Christ is to have permanent
significance for us it must be because it explains
this process, which has lasted‚ and will last, with
the human race on earth, and, if we may reason
by analogy, will be the method of progress in the
future environment of humanity.

If we are to continue to accept Christianity‚
the doctrines of the Incarnation and the Atone—
ment, which are its warp and woof‚ must offer
the most fundamental explanation of existence as
we now apprehend it, must be demanded as an
explanation by every fact within our cognisance.
