things new to anything like the same degree as
does the rising and falling of the cactus forms.

Thus we see that while allorganic nature shares
in some degree the nature of what is inorganic it is
distinguished from it, first, by being more gentle
and adaptable3 secondly, by being more positive
in its ways and results—ever enterprising‚ as we
may say.

The third characteristic which distinguishes the
organic from the inorganic is that it displays always
a capacity for greater difference and closer union.
One tree from another tree, one animal from
another animal, differs in many more points than
two grains of sand or two mountains can differ
from each other. The trees and the animals are
also more closely united, and the more highly
developed organic life is, the greater is its variety
and the more close the bond that unites it.
Under this head we must look beyond the
difference and union which characterize organic
life in general to forms of them that are dis-
tinctively human, for in humanity, certainly, the
greatest difference and closest union are to be
found. We have seen how personality involves
the profoundest difference. What is the charac—
teristic of that closest union which in humanity
becomes brotherhood ?

When we consider any human life in the light
of its service to the whole of humanity‚ we per-
ceive that we are surrounded by two distinct sorts
of service: the one is that of a creature who by
furthering his own ends, so far as his conscious
aim is concerned‚ performs his highest function
