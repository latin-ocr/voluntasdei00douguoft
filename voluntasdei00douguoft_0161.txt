as guardian and educator of the life of vegetation
and become its author. To simplify the case
as much as possible, let us imagine him alone in
space and time creating a hitherto·-unthought—of
thing. His first action must be to form a new
conception; let us suppose that conception be
of what we now call a rose. The conception
must include the rosebush which bears the flower.
But if he conceive the new flower as possessing
always the same group of characteristics——every
rose the replica of every other—-it is evident
that would be a meagre conception compared with
a conception that, with fundamental similarities of
structure, admitted many varieties in size, form,
scent, colour, etc., all good and beautiful.

It is clear that the creative intelligence of the
gardener must first conceive the rose-life, and that
to form that conception is to set its limits. The
rose-character is a definite thing, and every healthy
and beautiful form into which the rose-life might
develop without losing its own definite character
might be called perfect. Degree of possible per-—

fection, and possible variety of perfection, would
be limited by character.

It is probable that not only must its character
be definite, but its proper power. For simplicity
we are trying to do what is, of course, impossible
—to conceive of rose· life as unrelated to anything
but the thought of the gardener-creator. Even
so experience teaches us that there must be a limit
to the possible size and quantity of any variety if
beauty is to be always realised. We constantly
recognise the fact that increase of size or number
