SYNOPSIS

Along the linc of intelligent life we get greater and greater
autonomy, which at last calls for what we know as the highest
form of purpose—that of the parent or teacher.

Pantheistic thought identtfies the life of the universe with G0d3
but life lends itself both to good and evil, to progress and retro-
gression. It appears saner to regard life as the not-Cori, which
came from God, andis being trained by Him to form with Himself
a new unity.

It is never life that is limited, but the power of the organism to
utilise life for its own ends. The perfection of the organism
would be its power to utilise life fully for its highest end.

When life at last in man becomes conscious of itself, and able
consciously to respond to God‚ we get “spiritual life,‘’ which
entails pre-eminently the power to utilise more and more of the
universal life for the highest end.

The speculations of this chapter seem to harmonise with experience.

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ

ΡκονιῡΕΝεΕ ΑΝι) AUTONOMY

Can we detect in world evolution a purpose which tallies with the
types of0purpose we have found in man?

The order we perceive in inorganic nature tallies with such human
purpose as we have called mechanical.

In the earliest stage of life physical strength and adaptation seem
to be the airn.

Later on the aim seems to be a balance of physical force and intelli-
gence 3 not the strongest body, nor the strongest intelligence, but
the best combination of these persists, We therefore get defects
in the physical nature and in intelligence handed down along
the line of fullest life.

Later, when what we call God consciousness or spIritual life is
added, nature again strives sor a balance of the three qualitie53
again defects in each aspect are handed down along the line of
fullest life.

The purpose suggested by the development of human life is health
of body and brain, excellence of intelligence, excellence of will
power, excellence of extra-regarding impulses which make for the
perfection of corporate life. The prevailing desire of nature
seems to be to rid itself of defects in all these.

The disease germ or parasite does not belong to the method, but
militates against the purpose.

If this tendency to excellence of life indicates God’s will, very much
must happen in our universe which merely represents the will
of the autonomous creature before it is won by the persuasive
purpose of God.

If disease and defect were the will of God, God and the life-force
would be at war.
