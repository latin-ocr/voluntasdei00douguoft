xxiv VOLUNTAS DEI

paca

For the abounding life of God received by a man is ample to
produce full positive activity of all his powerS.

The attitude and teaching of the Church on the question of
marriage is an illustration of this mistake.

We judge all healthy life, not according to the sins omitted, but
according to the positive goodness and enterprise manifested, and
our highest praise for such enterprise is that it has originality.

Christianity⁷ if better than other religions, must differ from them
in giving greater stimulus to positive good of all sorts and to
the encouragement of enterprise and originality in the work of
moulding men to higher purposeS.

The older view was that God revealed exact instructions as to the
work He wanted done (as Moses received the pattern of the
Tabernacle in the mount), but we have discovered that God does
not thus use mechanical purpose toward humanity. Jesus gave
His disciples principles of action and the stimulus of a new life,
and left the method of applying principles to their own genius,
enriched by the mystic vision.

We only remain commonplace in our piety and stereotyped in our
methods because, from fear of a hard God, we wrap our religious
genius in a napkin‚ content to remain without the multiplied
product of spiritual enterprise, not realising that God is guarantor
for all positive effort, however great its apparent failure.

The early Church learned from its Lord that the force of God was
bringing to them the Kingdom3 hence the responsibility for it
was not on them, and they were free to fit men for its coming.

If to-day the responsibility for bringing in the Kingdom is mans,
Jesus has misled His Church. We may have misunderstood
time and method‚ but the teaching of Jesus is plain—that God
in Christ comes to mankind, not that mankind has to travel
painfully to find God. That is our sufficient warrant for ceaseless
enterprise in the effort to fit men to abide in that day.

All that makes for fulness of life is preparation for the Kingdom.
The marvellous works ascribed to Jesus are an epitome of the
activities the world-soul feels essential to salvation3 and God
being a faithful Creator, we must believe that what He teaches
the world—soul to aspire to is its proper goal.

Then, what Jesus was and did is a promise for the future condition
and power of mankind 3 and just in so far as men work as He
did to fit men's bodies and minds for the coming Kingdom‚ so
far may they count on being inspired and inwrought by God.

CHRISTIAN UN1TY . . . . . . . 239

We assume in the universe a unity of purpose.
Hence we assume that things and persons sharing a common
nature have a community of origin and destiny.
