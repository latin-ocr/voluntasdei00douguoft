CHAPTER XIX

PAIN AND PUNISHMENT

Assuming a psychic life, latent or ‹leveloped‚ in all orginic things, capac1ty
sor suffering exists only with the development of consciousness, and is
proportioned to the degree in which consciousness is developed.

Possibility of physical failure we share with animals anrl plants, moral and
mental failure belong to intelligent life alone.

A failing organism may transmit life, but that life will be in some degree
‹legenerate.

Thus, individual life can proceed to higher and higher forms, or it may
‹liverge and deteriorate—a process fraught with pain.

Such pain is clearly a danger signal. It cannot be regarded as punishment,
because it always falls heavily on the innocent.

The suffering of sympathy is the highest type ofsuffering, and with ‹legeneracy
the power to sympathise grows less.

Sympathy, being characteristic of the finest and most sensitive matures,
involves the keenest suffering. Hence such suffering cannot be disciplinary.
were it so, we could not believe that God suffers, and did Hc not suffer
He would not be the Christian God.

We thus cannot regard suffering as G0‹1’s punishment of the evil or His
discipline of the good.

We are driven to believe God permits sin, though He does not ordain it 3 the
same seems true of suffering, which is the product of sin.

Conceiving our present existence as but a stage in an immor-tal progress, we
cannot regard it, even as a stage, as perfectly exhibiting the will of God.
Rather, all creation, free within its limits, is only learning to conform to
God’s will, and is not always doing its best to learn.

Hence we conceive ofGod as neither ordaining sin nor suffering, but as ordain-
ing freedom to do right or wrong3 and in thus ordaining He accepts the
greatest share of any suffering that may flow from it for the sake of our
attaining to free co-operation with His will.

While it is thus impossible to think God ordains punishment, yet punish—
ment exists in the numbing degeneracy that overtakes the misdirected life
when it refuses to accept the warning of pain.

Neither from the teaching of our Lord nor frorn the trend of our experience
have we any assurance that all such erring personalities shall ultimately
be saved, but our conception of creative purpose makes it necessary to
believe that even if the individual mind finally disintegrate, it will be
reabsorbed into the created life-force, to rise again through personality to
union with God.

As things are, the return to the normal onward path of every erring soul is
possible by saith in God’s re—creative power.
