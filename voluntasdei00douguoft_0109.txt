CHAPTER VI

UNION OF GOD WITH CREATION

As the line of tendency in evolution passes through intelligence to conscious-
ness of God and the immortal hope, it points to a destiny that is union
with God.

Eternal truth can only be apprehendet! by a variety of analogies.

The idea of union thus considered. Plant and seedling. Animal and off-
spring. In the union of herd, hive, flock, unity of purpose is added to
unity of kind. Greater difference goes with closer union, as in unity of
marriage, unity of understanding.

Difference‚ personality, sels-hond are necessary to a high degree of unity.
We have no conception of real unity that does not depend on difference.
Four sorts of unity——of kind, of purpose, of feeling, of interpretation. All

these exemplified in the brief hour of family life.

But man seeks an abiding union on these lines. Hence——

1. Ancestor-worship—identifying kindred with God.

z. Tribal gods—deifying the corporate purpose.

3. Mystery religions, involving unity of feeling—deifying the intuitions
of the race.

4. Philosophies, involving unity of interpretation—deifying intellectual
conceptions.

The religion which can satisfy humanity must offer all these sorts of unity
in one, and the unity must be between different persons—man and God.

It is this to which nature unconsciously tends. It is this which man

consciously seeks. It is in this search that God meets man bestowing
re-creative love.
