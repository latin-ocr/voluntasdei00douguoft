vary from His purpose, it is, Ι think, impossible
to suppose that it could vary so much as to baffle
that purpose. For we have seen that wherever
creation is in the stage where God exercises what
we have called mechanical purpose, it has little
autonomy, that nature becomes more and more
capable of opposition to Him as it becomes more
highly organised. That is why we instinctively
feel that the stars in their courses obey God better
than we do. But we cannot suppose that the
will of the most highly organised creature could
ultimately overbear God's purpose. Before that
point could be reached the individual energy must
become sels-disintegrating, if that be possible 3 and
the individual life-energy would in that case enter
again the flux of world-energy. All I want to
make clear here is that we cannot reasonably use
the words “ universe‚'' “ universal,'' “ creative pur—
pose,'' “divine purpose'' without perceiving that
they involve a consummatior] of which every
surviving thing must be a component part, and
that in a sense that we do not at present see
accomplished in the terrestrial life of the indi—
vidual things around us.

We need to dwell on this point with real
thought but not fancifully, with real sentiment
but not sentimentally. Think, for example, of the
ploughshare driven through the daisy root and
the nest of the field-mouse, both of necessity
ruthlessly destroyed at the beginning of a beautiful
little life. Think of rabbits in a field of corn:
the reaping machine and the reapers go round in
ever—narrowing circles3 the frightened rabbits
