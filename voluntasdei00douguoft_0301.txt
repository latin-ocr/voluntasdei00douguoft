SALVATION BY JOY 269

our religious belief in the divine ordering of the
universe.

We cannot believe that all the long process
of man's biological evolution can point to anything
less than the physical excellence of our race3 the
cry of sentient physical creation in long travail
comes to our ears telling us that it is not for
nothing that God in sympathy with every creature
has suffered thus. The preparation of the physical
body, the preparation of the social body or state,
has been going on for many millenniums and is
not yet consummated. In that future earthly
Kingdom of God we may suppose that the forces
of what we call inanimate nature will be for the first
time understood and brought under perfect con-
trol, and that the government will be theocratic,
and also democratic, for all that we call the law of
nature and of God will be written in the heart of
men and of things.

Again, we cannot face the facts of reality within
the self, and the growing and developing religious
experience of humanity, without being convinced
that even if—an impossible thought—all men
could arise from the dead and participate in the
final earthly consummation, the self could not
therein be satisfied. Even in our present half-
developed condition we cry as children for some—
thing that earth can never give, and the experience
of the religious life brings stronger and stronger
assurance that the joys of earth are but steps to
more intense unearthly joy. Without doubt these
yearnings, these assurances, come to us on the
physical and psychical sides by direct inheritance 3
