x OMNIPOTENCE 13¹

So far we have been considering how the rose—
life is limited by the necessity of conforming to
certain outward conditions; let us now consider
how it is limited in the secret of its being, limited
by the conception of a double-stranded force which
reproduces itself, by matings and by separation, in
innumerable strands‚ which, crossing and recrossing,
may develop these different possibilities. I do not
here enter into the problem of whether we can
conceive how a rose—life can be self—directing.
Great as are the difficulties of the conception, I
think it is still more difficult to think why the
concept, which is real, should be translated into
the concrete at all if some experience has not to
be worked out in the concrete which was not in
the concept. I want to assume, for this illustration
of power, that the rose-life possesses a self-directing
force as we believe our own life to have. If at any
point, then, and in any degree, it has the choice of
how it will cross and recross, or whether it will
develop or fail, such amount of self-direction must
mean that the creator of roses does not know
which of all the possible forms of perfection will
develop and which will fail. Failure might mean
the final loss of certain possibilities of excellence ;
it might mean that when these flickered out the
rose energy in them began again to develop in
some other rose stock; but it is certain that the
concept of self—directing life means the concept of
possible failure and the concept of the possible
amount of that failure. The concept of rose-life
must then include the utmost possibility of definite
perfection of character and the utmost possibility of
