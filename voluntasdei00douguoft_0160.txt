In dealing with the child, then, power in the
nurse lies in the ability to conceive at any moment
of such behaviour to be produced in the child as
will realise in him the strongest character with the
greatest deference for the precepts she would instil.
Next, she must so adjust her action as to produce
that behaviour. The physical ability to move the
child from one place to another, to punish or
reward it, only indicates power to effect her pur-
pose when it is used in absolute subordination to
her inner conception of the character she wishes to
mould.

Thus we have seen that the power which a
nurse exhibits in capricious action is a low degree of
power, and her ability to influence the after life of
humanity through her charge is a higher degree of
power. The nurse acts always as architect or artist
on material provided for the exercise of her power.
If to this power to build up could be added the
power to create the material on which she works‚
it is clear that we should have a still higher degree
of power, of which we have no experience.

It is this creative power, as well as administra-
tive power, that we always associate with Omnipo—
tence ; and we conceive of Omnipotence as bringing
forth the whole complexity of things. In this
association the idea of creation baffles our analysis ;
but let us consider what our simplest idea of creative
power would be.

Consider what creative power might be in a
gardener if he could for once exceed his function
