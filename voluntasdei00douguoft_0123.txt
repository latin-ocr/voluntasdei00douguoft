CHAPTER VII

NEWNESS OF LIFE

WE see evidence in various times and places of
something that seems quite new entering into
human history—a new idea, a new art, a new
invention—making a fresh starting—point for human
activity. It is the same with what we call animal
life and vegetable life; every new species must
have had its starting-point. Life is always new.
In a sense this is the commonest of truismS, for
every individual organism is different from every
other; but it is also true that the momentum of
every fresh starting-point is always pulsing on,
rising, gathering force, spreading itself like waves
that pass the movement on through water until
some larger wave, as it were accidentally, seems to
have sufficient power to break down some barrier
that till then had been impregnable. The accident
is only apparent ; the force was there and growing
all the time3 and if the water, after the apparent
accident, rushes into some hollow of the shore,
making an inland sea that never again recedes, it
is not because there was a new force. Yet the
inland sea is new.
