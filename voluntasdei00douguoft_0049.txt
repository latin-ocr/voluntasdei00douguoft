INTRODUCTION 17

the only absolute, certainty of their lives. Joy is
theirs-—joy beyond all words, often beyond even
the practical outward expression of lightsome
demeanour, yet often including that also. Within
their hearts is an ever-growing persuasion that joy
unspeakable surrounds them in the unseen and
still awaits their ultimate discovery. They will
refer to this authority or that as the basis of their
belief, but the fact that, while it grows year by year
more strong, more pervasive of the whole sphere
of their consciousness‚ it remains outwardly incom-
municable, is perhaps an indication that its true
source cannot be cited among religious authorities
on earth. Further‚ this incommunicable and joyful
assurance in God, which in emergency is seen to
be the very garment of salvation, the robe of
righteousness, is certainly not the reward of any-
thing we recognise as ethical merit. Many who
attain to the highest merit of this sort are without
it; many who possess it have not earned Ξῖ by
exalted conduct, and would be the first to disclaim
moral pre-eminence. In any right-minded con-
sideration of religious evidence this important fact
must be taken into account. To the present
writer it appears to weigh down the scale on the

side of the God hypothesis.
