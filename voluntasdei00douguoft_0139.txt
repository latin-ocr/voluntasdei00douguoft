CHAPTER IX

SON OF GOD

The universal conviction that man can do right but does not, makes it
reasonable to expect that a man should some time appear who does right.
But goodness cannot be achieved by individual effort alone5 it must be also
the gift of destiny‚ i.e. predestination.

Individual man, personal though he be, is indivisible from the stream of life.

Man is thus born into a scheme of things which, if free-will and the sense
of sin be realitics, as we believe, is not perfectly adjusted to God's will.
While it is probable that what works against God's will is sels-destructive,
which limits possible extent of discord, such discord when personal may
be the diabolic clement which, as well as the divine, environs the spirit
of man.

It is certain that every child chooses between ideals determined by forces
other than itself.

Every individual is partly made, and wholly environed, by forces other than
himself.

This undoubted truth underlay the ancient stories of the divine or regal
descent of every great man.

In the Hebrew poem of creation all life originates from the brooding of the
spirit, and Hebrew prophets looked forward to the perfecting of human

polity as an act of God, cosmology and eschatology thus alike figuring
forth the truth that all that is good is of God.

Again, if we take the “ fruits of the Spirit ’' and their opposite, as described
by St. Paul, we see that only in a community or family where the fruits
exist and their opposites are absent, can the best sort of child be born.

Whether, then, the doctrine of the divine Fatherhood of Jesus be fact, or
only a poetic representation of fact, the idea it symbolises is still true.

If the Incarnation was the culmination of the world-process, it could only
be the beginning of a saving life3 further, that lise, if truly human, must
go on to develop in the heavens. For true humanity implies much more
than a body in human shape inhabited by Divinity3 it involves 3 personal
immortality.

This asserted in the Pauline doctrine of the resurrection and mediation of
Christ.

The Church now admits she has mistaken crisis for process in her doctrine
of the first, and also of the last, things. The Church may also have
mistaken crisis for process in her account of the Advent of Christ.

But he who sees truth and mistakes its form lives more wisely than he who
fails entirely to see it.
