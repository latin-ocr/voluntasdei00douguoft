closest union with God which implies the greatest
difference—the difference between personalitieS.
For we cannot conceive of this conscious union
of God and man without attributing personality to
both God and man. We are so made that we
cannot conceive of such a union except between
persons ; without that we get, not union, but same-
ness, something that is, indeed, neither human nor
divine, but a mere thing which we may call a force
or principle.

Now we are assuming that all nature tends to
its own perfection, defining perfectiori as that limit
of health‚ strength, beauty, and wisdom which each
organism can reach. We believe that God seeks
to draw nature into such perfection. When taking
large views which cover long reaches of time and
space, we can certainly see tendencies that make for
such perfection. Yet we rarely see anything in any
grade of being that appears perfect. Very much
that we hold to be most picturesque, most lovely,
most dear, is so because of its imperfection. How
far this may be due to nature's autonomy is a point
we must consider later on, but in concrete fact we
are forced to perceive that while excellence in
individual cases is as conspicuous in one age
as in another, the number of instances in which
excellence is attained increase as the environ—
ment becomes more favourable. Eg. the possi-
bilities of an elm tree are not greater than in ages
past, but anywhere, given their best environ—
ment, they may reach excellence. It is so with
any race of animals, and so with man. The human
race does not apparently produce finer individuals
