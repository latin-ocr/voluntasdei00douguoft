THE UNIVERSAL WEAL 187

wrong on earth—the existing human state—must
be disintegrated‚ all that was right must blossom
and glow into a perfect human polity—the reign of
God as in heaven so on earth 3 while at the same
time His ultimate gaze was fixed always upon a
spiritual humanity of which He felt himself to
be the shepherd-king, whose destiny was not of this
earth. “ Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
my teaching shall not pass away.''

We must, therefore, hold our minds fixed upon
the purpose of God, and bring all our thoughts
into obedience to the knowledge that within that
purpose there cannot be diverging lines. The
perfection of earth wrought by human ministry‚
the physical perfection of the universe in which
earth is but a speck, and the spiritual perfection
of universal life—these, as necessary parts of one
purpose, must have vital interdependence on one
another. Eaeh is necessary to the weal of God.
This universal perfection must always be the goal of
the extra-regarding purpose of corporate humanity,
both in its earthly and immortal life.
