When we ask how it came to be there, what is the
cause and nature of its music, I think the hypothesis
of those who are materialists is that the piano makes
the music, and as we have no evidence whatever
that any one moves the piano or constructed it, we
are bound to rule out those ideas, and accept the
material of the piano, with its power of motion,
as primal facts, its construction and music arising
from a succession of changes which proceed accord—
ing to laws discernible by close study.

A second hypothesis is that of some force that
we might call the force of life-wisdom or spirit,
producing matter and entering into co—operation
with matter to produce the various present forms
of life, and finally human life. For this theory
the man pressing the buttons is the spirit or life-
wisdom, which has produced all the form we see.
In man, for example, the body with its complex
structure of brain and nerve, is the piano3 within
it is the life-wisdom, producing changes in will,
emotion, thought, with their concomitant changes
in the brain.

The third hypothesis is that the construction
of the piano and the nature of the music require
a constructor and composer to be assumed, and
man's natural desire for unity and economy of
assumption causes him to consider these two as
one. This hypothesis gives full weight to the
assumption of the unseen operator as an integral
part of the machine, but urges the fact that we
observe his power of execution to be limited to
a certain musical programme, and his power of
