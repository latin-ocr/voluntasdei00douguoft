v1 UNION OF GOD WITH CREATION 81

to any aspect of the universe, they find their
mental attitude so coincides that they are said to
see “eye to eye‚'' and whatever new thing either
sees is an addition to the vision of the other ; what-
ever one doubts becomes a problem to the other.
Here, in friendship‚ we get perhaps the closest
degree of unity of which we can conceive 3 that is,
if the persons who make component parts of this
unity of understanding are such that the will and
feeling of each is in harmony with his own under-
standing, and therefore in harmony with that of
his friend.

I think it becomes evident that the reason that
these four sorts of unity are closer in humanity
than in less complex forms of life is that every
human being is first of all a person, a self or spirit,
an entity all to himself, first excluding all other
beings from himself in order that he may become
more perfectly one with them again. A dog can—
not have so high a degree of unity with another
dog as a man can have with a man, just because
a dog can never be so truly separate from another
dog as a man from a man. As a mere matter of
everyday experience in the facts of common life,
we find that we have no conception of real unity
between living things that does not depend on
difference. That is just where Pantheism fails to
interpret and to stimulate life. We have no
knowledge of anything but life; we cannot con—
ceive of anything except in the terms of life ; life
involves difference. If the eternal truth cannot be
interpreted for us in terms of life it cannot be
truth for us,
