CHRISTIAN UNITY 247

civilisation the world had yet known, and we are
not so far in advance of these now. What could
the world show finer in its time than the mono—
theism of the Jews and the purity of their ideals,
persona] and social? What could it show more
widely humane than the broad administrative'
principle of the Roman Empire, that the prejudices
and passions ofa subject people should be humoured
on occasion, even at the expense of justice to the
individual ?

Religion and civilisation at their best were
bound to be in opposition to Jesus, because they
concentrated themselves on the defence of the
good already revealed, already attained. What
they feared was a relapse into some worse con—
dition. Jesus impersonated the saith that man
and his paltry attainments‚ lying in the hollow
of God’s hand, was offered a glorious future in
return for a paltry past. What else is repentance
but the voluntary yielding of the past in exchange
for a God-given future? The repentance that
Jesus demanded was religious, political, social, as
well as personal. The representatives of religious
and civil power behaved like the children of a
king who should refuse to lay down some toys
already theirs and leave their nursery for richer
delights, under the impression that if they did so
they would lose all they possessed, while their
lives and all they had depended upon the paternal
benevolence which they mistrusted.

Peter wanted to see Jesus taking sides with
some already existing right, terrorising His
enemies, honoured by all who were well disposed.
