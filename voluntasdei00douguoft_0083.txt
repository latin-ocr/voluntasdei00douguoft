ιιι PROVIDENCE AND AUTONOMY 51

autonomy is real, the supreme purpose of the
universe does not work “to will and to do of
His good pleasure’' except when the creature
works out its own salvation, salvation being con—
formity to that good pleasure,

When the creature does so work, a higher thing
is accomplished than could be wrought between
precise forecast and exact fulfilment. When the
creature does not so work, all that is required
for the completion of God's purpose is that the
energy used at variance with the purpose should
be conserved until it gives itself to the ultimate
service of the purpose, either by accepting the
regenerative, re-creative influence of God, or by
lapsing into the universal life to be re—formed.

This view of Providence seems to correspond
with the aphorisms of the Gospel concerning
prayer: any change for the better asked from
God shall be realised in the future process of
creation; every change that man can now make
his own by saith is already accomplished. If all
things were now divinely appointed, how could
we understand this teaching ?
