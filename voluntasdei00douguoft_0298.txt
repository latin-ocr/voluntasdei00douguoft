266 VOLUNTAS DEI

(b) The Christian aspiration, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven,'’ reflects the be1ief that God designs a free earthly crea-
tion to become, in co-operation with Him, “good.''

(c) Our belief that mankind is one, making it man's duty to work for
humanity present and future, involves the conviction that the
earthly perfectiori of the race is part of every man’s own salva-
tion.

Faith, hope, charity receive an enduring stimulus in the belief that the very
image, the very life, of God is latent in all things, and is being evoked
from all things.

Because the Christian revelation shows God as opposed to all pain and
wrong, and shows Him as suffering in 311 pain and wrong, the world is
saved by the joyful realisation that God Himself is its Saviour.

Christian repentance is the turning from all thought that in God is any
darkness at all.
