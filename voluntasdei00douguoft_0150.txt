gulf of blue. The eye may single out the

majestic form of one unblemished tree; the bole
is a mighty tower3 the lower branches, dark and
rugged, are interlocked with its dark fellows in
their own impenetrable twilight; but far above,
some indefinable height above the shadows of the
grove, the upper part towers splendid in the sun-
shine, looking as young and strong and perfect as
if God had made it with a word but yesterday.
Before Rome was great this tree and all its
possibilities were contained in a tiny germ. Any
malformation of that seed, any weakening of that
seed, would have made the symmetry and size of
the tree for ever impossible. A tree it might still
have been, to some extent puny, stunted, or lop—
sided, not this glorious creation, this splendid
degree of correspondence to the thought of God.
This significance of the germ is wrapped in all
the teaching of our Lord. His teaching con-
cerning “eternal life '' constantly suggests that
what is done here will have effect in its result
on all future ages through which the individual
spirit must pass. Now, this development from
germ is a very essential part of our humanity 3 it
is difficult to conceive of any life being truly
human that does not participate in it. The
significance of the germ is wrapped also in all the
processes of terrestrial life3 a human life perfect
in this stage would afterwards (naturally become
more and more powerful and gloriOUS. The
divine Son upon earth must continue to be in
further regions of spirit what He was potentially
on earth. This is asserted in the Pauline doctrine
