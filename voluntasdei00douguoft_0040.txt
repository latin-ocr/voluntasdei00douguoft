rosy mists of an English dawn. If both be the

experiments of a wisdom that can be identified with
the life they manifest, I see no reason to assume
that man, “ pealing the psalm to wintry skies, '' is
anything more than a like experiment

With regard to the third hypothesis, granting
that to the spectators nothing is or can be visible
but the piano, that nothing is or can be audible
but the music, granting that some of them have
assumed the piano to be the sole cause of the
music, and that some of them have assumed an
unseen operator, there would seem but one reason
for any one assuming a greater musician than the
operator to be the composer, a greater mechanician
to be the constructor, that is, that neither of these
gives an adequate explanation of the facts involved.
What we need to explain is, how the piano and its
music can be derived from either the mere piano,
or the piano plus the musician whose limited power
is manifested in his imperfect execution. On the
materialistic hypothesis the material of the piano
has been analysed, and its simplest elements, matter
and motion, have been accepted as the cause of its
construction and the music it produces. Under
the second hypothesis the operator, whose repeti-
tions, with but slight variations, proclaim his
limited power of composition, is held to be the
composer. It would seem to be merely the in—
ability of some minds to find either of these
explanations adequate that produces the hypothesis
of a Mozart or a Broadwood.

Now it will be immediately seen that this
analogy for the universe is not as good as it would
