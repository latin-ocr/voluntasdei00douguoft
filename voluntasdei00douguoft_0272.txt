240 VOLUNTAS DEI

Peter, wishing earthly power and honour for his Lord‚ was in effect desiring
to see Him take sides in the current clash of right and wrong.

Jesus stood for the saith that the taint of evil was over all the current world,
that hope lay in the coming of the perfect reign of God. In compelling
His crucifixion He attested this saith by His death.

We are therefore bound to believe that God sides with an ideal righteousness
just beyond our sight, which all men alil-:e fail to reach, whence the folly
of judgment and condemnation among men is evident3 we see also that
God shows Himself in Jesus as abiding most with those who suffer most
under His own gift of freedom, those who are condemned and outcast by
a world itself condemned by God but not cast out from God.

The outlook on the Kingdom implies that no reverse can come to any insti-
tution except from its own inward evil. lt follows that it is useless to
fight against a menacing force3 internal reform is the only safeguard.

Further‚ if we realise that God suffers with those whom we condemn or
ostracise or punish, we must, at the expense of our own rights and dignsty,
find some other way of winning them.
