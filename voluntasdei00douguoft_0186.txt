In this we see an illustration of how inadequate
our thought is to formulate the simplest and
most fundamental part of our life knowledge. We
know that perfection in any kind of life consists
in correspondence of two things that seem quite
different. Thus, we say that the perfection of a
rose depends upon the skill and power of the
gardener——skill and power to give it the best con-
ditions 3 but we know, too, that it depends on the
vitality of the shoot or seed from which he starts
the plant, while again the vitality of shoot or seed
depends on some prior excellence of environment.
We say then that the pei-fection of the rose
depends on the conditions provided by the
gardener and on the fitness of the shoot or seed,
while yet it has no growth or root, to enter into
the processes of growth and root. The funda—
mental fact behind this is the mysterious thing we
call the rose—life, which no gardener can create, and
which flows with fulness only when it meets with
fit conditions‚ and which is itself the condition of
good reproduction. It is exactly the same with
a sheep or an ox; we have the outer environ-
mcnt and the inner life. The environment is
something which comes from the power and skill
outside the animal 3 the inner life is something we
cannot conceive of apart from the animal, and
which obeys laws that the herdsman cannot com-
mand but only serve. A perfect environment,
then, is simply that which perfectly corresponds
with the inner individual life; the life must exist,
and must be good, before the good environment
is determined. The life, then, determines its own
