xw THE UNIVERSAL WEAL 179

time in its career may plunge into darkness or
dash into pieces in a blaze of light, we yet cannot
conceive of its energy as ceasing to contribute
something to the whole. Thus the law of the
conservation of energy, when we consider things
deeply, is found to be a law of purposeful thought.
Anything else than this would be chaos. We may
say the same thing of the planets of a solar system 3
if that system is to have its age of maturity and
perfectiori, each planet must contribute to it.
Thus, we conceive of the perfection of our planet
Jupiter as having a more direct bearing on the
perfection of our solar system than upon the
perfection of, let us say, the system of Arcturus,
or any other solar system.

In the same way, when we come to our
terrestrial world and to the races of organic things
upon it, we must think of its flora and fauna as
minor entities whose perfection or conformity to
the divine ideal of their health and beauty bears
on the greater perfectiori of the world to which
they belong. Although the human race has for
ages regarded both these either as existing accident-
ally, as it were, or to subserve the purpose of
humanity ; as far as we can now see, a very great
deal goes on in the animal and vegetable worlds
for which man has not, and never can have, any
use, and as we cannot now conceive them as
outside God's purpose, we must think they sub-
serve some other purpose of God. The animals
of the jungle, the birds that haunt the polar seas,
the splendid poisonous vines of the tropics‚ the
not less splendid flowering plants that blossom
