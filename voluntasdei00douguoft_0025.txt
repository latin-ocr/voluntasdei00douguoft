SYNOPSIS

The goal of God must be also the goal of man. With God he
must co-operate‚ first to attune his mind and will to God’s, and
then to lift humanity and all creation to perfectiori.

How can we conceive that universal perfectiori ?

The universe being the outcome of one purpose, we conceive :111 its
parts and their perfection as inter-dependent.

Similarly, confining ourselves to our own world and all it contains,
we must realise that the most insignificant plant or animal,
though it may not directly serve humanity. must subserve the
all-embracing purpose of God in some way.

For if God could disregard his lower creations when man came
forth, He could disregard man if in some other world a higher
racc were evolved.

Hence humanity can only feel assured os salvation because of the
saith that God wills the salvation of the whole.

Thus the argument for man's salvation founded on the idea of the
earth as the centre of the universe, and man as its supreme pro-
duct, must give way to an argument consonant with the idea of

the relative insignificance of our earth in the universe, and of

man's life upon it. That argument must be the universality
of God’s purpose as embracing the least of His creatum, and a
consummation of that purpose which we do not see on earth, in

which every class of life must have its part, for if any part of
the universe can be godless, the whole may be.

Our Lord taught emphatically that nothing lives or dies without
God.

The universality of the Divine purpose will only overwhelm and
confuse our thought unless, with Jesus Christ, we centre atten-
tion on its fatherliness‚ involving as it does a consummation
that will fulfil the promise of all things.

Such vision of God’s end, though we can only see it in blurred out-
line, can help us to the rejecting of paltry ideas of God's Church
and His heaven, and to some hint of reconciliation between the
world-affirming and the world—negating spirit.

The universal perfection‚ in which consists the weal of God, must

always'be the goal of the extra-regarding purpose of corporate
umanity.

CHAPTER XV

WORLD AFFIRMATION

Those beliefs which account to a man for existence are his real
creed. When any faith ceases to do this for men it ceases to be
a living religion.

A religion may be genuinely adhered to which is not a key to
existence, but it is a dying religion.

The Pharisaic religion in the time of Christ is an instance.

The permanent element in religion is the effort of each age to
reconcile religious feeling and knowledge.
