134 VOLUNTAS DEI effi

responsibility for evil to believe that life resists His
will, it enables us to regard God as permitting
what is against His own desire or will, what is,
in fact, unnecessary.

It is quite impossible, however we may wish to
do it, for us to conceive of an Omnipotence that
can do, or can have, all things that seem to us
good. F ew things seem to us more desirable than
insight into the way in which, as we say, things
are going to work. A forecast of the future, into
which our own action can be so dovetailed as to
ensure its success, seems to us very desirable‚
although it is possible that the great joy of success
lies in just that small element of uncertainty that
gives a plan laid by the clearest insight a flavour
of risk. In any case we should admit that if we
were able to know more perfectly the end of actions
from the beginning a great deal of failure and
misery could be avoided, even if the corresponding
excitement of joy had to be forgone; we there-
fore think that complete foreknowledge must be
characteristic of Omnipotence.

Again, there is nothing that seems to us more
desirable than the something better than we
have ever experienced, which is at bottom the
object of all our hopes and all our efforts—in the
garden a new hybrid, in travel a new country to
discover, in physics a new element or a new law,
in art a new creation‚ in religion a fresh inspira-
tion. Now, it is quite clear that if God has
prescience of all things He can never have this
which seems to us the supreme joy.

All this must show us how entirely inadequate
