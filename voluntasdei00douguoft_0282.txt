sinful in their action than the Roman governor,
and he prays for His executioners as not knowing
the wrong they did. This is the prayer of one
who had been long accustomed to make excuses
to himself for the perpetrators of the many
cruelties that were the frequent wayside sights of
the day. No man could love men as Jesus did
without seeing the confusion of good and evil in
thought, feeling, and circumstance that animated
all the men He was accustomed to meet. There
can be no doubt of the truth of the old theologica]
doctrine that the Cross was the condemnation of
an error and a sin common to humanity. Seeing
that the best was bad, it was natural to the human
heart of Jesus to take His stand in this world
with the most condemned, with the most cruelly
punished. What then! does it not behove the
criminal, the heretic‚ to suffer at the hands of
society? at the hands of the Church? That is
a very large question, one that involves all social
science ; but one thing the Cross of Christ makes
clear———that it behoves God to suffer With all
sinners. How else could it be? How could
God give freedom and shirk the consequences?
What the Cross says in effect, in answer to all
our judgments of condemnation, is, “Let him
who is without sin among you condemn.'’ But if,
being sinful, you must punish, be sure that God
is suffering with those you punish. It is He who
suffers most under your attempts of good govern-
ment, even though He nerves your arm to make
the attempt—and this ought more especially to
modify ecclesiastical contests.
