xxvi VOLUNTAS DEI

The outlook on the Kingdom implies that no reverse can corneto
any institution except from its own inward evil. It follows that
it is useless to fight against a menacing force3 internal reform
is the only safeguard.

Further‚ if we realise that God suffers with those whom we con-
demn or ostracise or punish, we must, at the expense of our own
rights and dignity, find some other way of winning them.

CHAPTER XIX

ΡΑΙΝ ΑΝΙ) ΡυΝΙεΗΜΕΝΤ

Assuming a psychic life, latent or developed, in all organic things,
capacity for suffering exists only with the development of con-
sciousness, and is proportioned to the degree in which conscious—
ness is developed.

Possibility of physica] failure we share with animals and plants5
moral and mental failure belong to intelligent life alone.

A failing organism may transmit life, but that life will be in some
degree degenerate.

Thus, individual life can proceed to higher and higher forms, or it
may diverge and deteriorate—a process fraught with pain.

Such pain is clearly a danger signal. It cannot be regarded as
punishment, because it always falls heavily on the innocent.

The suffering of sympathy is the highest type of suffering, and with
degeneracy the power to sympathise grows less.

Sympathy being characteristic of the finest and most sensitive
natures, involves the keenest suffering. Hence such suffering
cannot be disciplinary. Were it so we could not believe that
God suffers3 and did He not suffer He would not be the
Christian God.

We thus cannot regard suffering as God's punishment of the evil
or His discipline of the good.

We are driven to believe God permits sin, though he does not
ordain it 3 the same seems true of suffering, which is the product
of sin.

Conceiving our present existence as but a stage in an immortal pro-
gress, we cannot regard it, even as a stage, as perfectly exhibit-
ing the will of God. Rather⁷ all creation, free within its limits,
is only learning to conform to God's will, and is not always
doing its best to learn.

Hence we conceive of God as neither ordaining sin nor suffering,
but as ordaining freedom to do right or wrong3 and in thus
ordaining He accepts the greatest share of any suffering that may
flow from it for the sake of our attaining to free co-operation
with His will.

While it is thus impossible to think God ordains punishment, yet
punishment exists in the numbing degeneracy that overtakes the
misdirected life when it refuses to accept the warning of pain.
