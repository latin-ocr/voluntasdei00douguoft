be most effectually carried out only when Christian
unity is both conscious and voluntary‚ inward and
outward. Its basis of power is gentleness as
opposed to the fighting spirit ; its method is per-
sonal initiative as opposed to mechanical obedience.
If service be spontaneous, and no power, physical
or moral, be brought to bear to enforce certain
sorts of spontaneity and suppress others, variety
and ever greater variety must result. If this be
not consonant with the truest and most vital unity
which humanity can know then Christianity is
divided against itself and cannot stand.

So far in history we have had three epochs in
Christendom : the first, of embryonic and unrecog—
nised divergence3 the second, of the use of con—
straint‚ physical and moral, to suppress divergence ;
the third, of recognised divergence and lack of
conscious and voluntary union. The problem of
achieving conscious and voluntary union with
adequate scope for variety still lies before the
Church.

We have seen that degeneracy tends to same-
ness and conscious isolati0n3 that the higher the
human spirit rises in the scale of being the more it
develops personal distinction and closest fellow-
ship. We are therefore bound to suppose that
personal distinction and union belong especially to
what may be called “the things of God,‘' and if
we consider the causes of religious disunion among
Christians we shall perhaps find that they chiefly
arise from a mistaken conception of what the
things of God among us really are.

It is a necessity of human nature to be social.
