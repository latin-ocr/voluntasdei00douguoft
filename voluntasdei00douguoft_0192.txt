or, as we say, came into real life. We know
something of the laws of Mendel, but they co-
exist with the fact that creatures that fly and run
and swim are choosing their mates the world
over, every moment and every hour, and their
freedom of choice as to the individual mate is
never denied by the plain man. Fulness of life
certainly runs along the line of those who are
fit to survive3 but other forms equally fit might
have come into being that never did. Therefore,
what has come into being is the result of a selective
process that is more than mere non-transgression
of law. The individual vegetable or animal has
no duplicate3 it has, therefore, of various possi-
bilities developed one, and this slight individual
variation in the course of ages causes variations
of kinds. But why is the variation in organic
forms more positive than, let us say, the variations
in sunsets ? Because new powers and new qualities
arise in the organic life. The shiftings of the
glories of light and vapour can occur evening by
evening for centuries, always different but bringing
no new thing to birth. It is different with life3
very slowly comes the new quality, the new power,
the new invention, but always there is the addition
of something new to the old.

We cannot be too clear about this distinction
between organic life and such action and motion as
we see in inorganic. Which of us has seen the
desert literally blossom as the rose? Here is
a serap of desert land, where nothing is but sand
and cacti. You see a little green point in the
sand which grows into a green projection dull in
