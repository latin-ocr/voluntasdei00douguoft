SYNOPSIS xv

ΓΑἰΙί

Illumination——foresight and insight-are to be had by holding the
activities stcadily directed to the right.

To this end God gives the universe autonomy, but exercises over
it fostering care.

Think of the fostering care of a parent, guardian, lover. Such care
can only impart illumination when its object sympathises with
its aims.

So Creative Intelligence watches over creation, ever ready to give
light to each ready recipient.

As in biological evolution we see physical senses coming to different
‹legrees of perfection, so in human history character evolves.
Light is always imparted to the individual as he is able to
grasp it.

God will first have full effect on human life when undeviating
adherence to right is produced in the human will.

The Incarnation.

Goodness realised reveals lack of goodness in all else. Thus we get
the proclamation of the reign of God in contrast to the current

world.

CHAPTER IX

SoN oF Goo . . . . . . . . 107

The universal conviction that man can do right but does not,
makes it reasonable to expect that a man should some time
appear who does right.

But goodness cannot be achieved by individual effort alone3 it
must be also the gift of destiny, i.e. predestination.

Individual man, personal though he be, is indivisible from the
stream of life.

Man is thus born into a scheme of things which, if free-will and the
sense of sin be realities, as we believe, is not perfectly adjusted
to God's will. While it Is probable that what works against
God’s will is sels-destructive, which limits possible extent of dis-
cord, such discord‚ when personal‚ may be the diabolic clement
which, as well as the divine, environs the spirit of man.

It is certain that every child chooses between ideals determined by
forces other than itself.

Every individual is partly made, and wholly environed, by forces
other than himself.

This undoubted truth underlay the ancient stories of the divine or
regal descent of every great man.

In the Hebrew poem of creation all life originates from the brood-
ing of the Spirit3 and Hebrew prophets looked forward to the
perfecting of human polity as an act of God, cosmology and
eschatology thus alike figuring forth the truth that all that is
good is of God.
