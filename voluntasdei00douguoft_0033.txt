INTRODUCTION

There are three common hypotheses of the origin of our universe.

These three set forth by analogies and examinet]—

1. The Materialistic hypothesis—that all things mechanically evolve,
and are mere combinations of matter.

2. The Psychic hypothesis—that spirit, potential in matter, has been
the formative principle, and will become more and more dominant.

3. The God hypothesiS.

The strong and weak points of each hypothesis considered.

If all three were equally reasonable, the fact that the third satisfies feeling
and activity as well as reason is likely to make it always the belief of the
greater part of mankind5 but there is no moral defect involved in the
acceptance of any of these theories by men who honestly find their natures
satisfied by them. The theist must whole-heartedly allow that an honest
man's intelligent adherence to what seems to him truth cannot be offensive
to God3 while materialist or psychist must not accuse theist of lack of
candour for adhering to the God hypothesis even though his reason may
not be wholly satisfied3 for it is probably quite as candid to adhere to
what satisfies volitional and emotional nature, although reason be not
wholly convinced‚ as to reject a satisfying belief merely because no reason-
able proof can be offered.

The fact of the diverse and unnumbered multitude living in what they believe
to be consciousness of God, must be considered in weighing the evidence

for the God hypothesis.
