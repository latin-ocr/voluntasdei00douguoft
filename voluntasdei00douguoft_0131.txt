CHAPTER VIII
SoN OF MAN

Man everywhere has the inward conviction that he could do right but
does not.

On the basis of this conviction all law and justice rest.

It would seem natural that this sense of ability to do right should find

realisation.
The man who attaincd to perfect volition would be the true Son of the racc.

1f rightness of will involves compassion manward‚ such an one must sym-
pathise with the shortcoming of his race.

Such rightness of will involves “singleness of eye,'' which is the way of
divine illumination.

Illumination—foresight and insight—are to be had by holding the activities
steadily directed to the right.

To this end God gives the universe autonomy, but exercises over it fostering
care.

Think of the fostering care of a parent, guardian, lover. Such care can only
impart illumination when its object sympathises with its aims.

So Creative Intelligence watches over creation, ever ready to give light to
each ready recipient.

As in biological evolution we see physical senses coming to different ‹legrees of
perfection‚ so in human history character evolves. Light is always im-
parted to the individual as he is able to grasp it.

God will first have full effect on human life when undeviating adherence to
right is produced in the human will.

The Incarnation.
Goodness realised reveals lack of goodness in all else. Thus we get the

proclamation of the reign of God in contrast to the current world.
