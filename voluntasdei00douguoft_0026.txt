xxii VOLUN TAS DEI

The central Christian doctrines must be felt to offer the most PAGE

fundamental explanation of the facts of existence as we know
them to—day if Christianity is to continue a vital religion and not
become a mere mythology.

The conception of the work of Christ developed in the early
Church as the possession of new facts required it.

The fact that Christian saith has always been able to assimilate
new knowledge, and re-read the Christian revelation in its light,
suggests that Christianity origin-ates in an external Power, not
m man.

There is no stopping-place in this process of development as facts
call for a more fundamental explanation.

The discovery In our times of the relative insignificance of our
world in the astronomical universe demands a deeper interpreta-
tion of the meaning of Christ's earthly life and death.

Consider how the conception of the union of the divine and the
human natures in Christ is affected by modern conceptions of
Divinity and humanity.

No longer able to suppose God concentrates care on this little earth,
we cannot suppose we know as much of what there is to know
about Him as before. Our case is like that of a child in the
nursery when he begins to find out that his father, though
devoted to his interests, has wider interests of which a child can
know nothing.

Again‚ humanity being but an incident in world evolution, and God
being involved in all material creation, the older conception of
the human spirit as wholly independent after death of the
physical universe and of other grades of life, is not tenable.
Rather‚ co-operation with God in a future life would seem to
consist in doing what we see He has always been doing for
creation, and fitness for that must be attained here in the effort
to re-create earth.

In the light of these new conceptions of Divinity and humanity the
Incarnation must manifest the relation of God not merely to
men but to the whole living creation, of which man is but a

art.

WE conceive the Atonement of Christ as manifesting God as work-
ing and suffering to bring man with His whole living creation
into free obedience to His will, until it fully express the character
He first conceived for it.

If man knows by experience that God in Christ thus deals with
him, then we have reason to think the larger creation of which
man is so intimate a part will also, by the patient love and
suffering of God, ultimately be conformed perfectly to His will.

The difficulty considered of holding that man's spirit is a special
and more direct creation of God, and that therefore the revelation
through Christ bears only on man's spiritual nature.

The modern philanthropic spirit can only be justified to the
Christian by seeing in it an attempt to work as God works to
redeem the whole terrestrial creation.
