1 QUALITIES OF PURPOSE 23

a precise forecast of results and an accurate fulfil-
ment of the forecast. With small portions of
what we call “dead matter’' man can deal thus,
but only with things that can be reproduced by
being measured and weighed. Tables, clocks‚ for
example, can be turned out by the hundred exact
to pattern 3 but the first clock, the first table, etc.,
must have grown under the creative imagination of
man to be something more than or different from the
mental forecast. Now, the will that works 1n con-
junction with creative imagination in man is neces-

sarily a stronger and more enduring form of volition
than that which 1s exercised in merely hewing and
beating or building matter into mechanical replicaS‚
because it must battle against obvious nullity. It
must be supported by faith in what is as yet unseen
and unfelt. When we come to purely artistic
work—the making of the statue, the painting, the
poem, the symphony— we come again upon a
necessity of pitting will against material nothing-
ness during the whole working out of the concep-
tion, and every true artist knows that what lures
him on, and at the same time wars against him, is
what seems to be a certain faint degree of autonomy
or self-assertion in the matter in which he works.
Sounds, colours‚ forms, letters—these all seem to
have a certain power of, here accepting, there
rejecting, the minuter details of the artist's concep-
tion 3 so that his ideal, struggling with the material
of its expression, grows and strengthens if he per-
sists in working it out. This persistence, although
it may be so great a joy that he is conscious of no
inward battle, is certainly a higher form of will—
