consciously to co-operate with Him. In what ought
this co-operation to consist? Certainly in two
things. First, all right growth and development
is co-operation with the Creator. The glowing of

stem of corn, the individual and parental activities
of all life, in so far as they are healthy, beautiful,
adjusted to the welfare of the whole, are in co-
operation with God. Secondly‚ in so far as growth
and development are not right, the making of them
right hy the Creator's own method of righting
wrong is co- -operation with Him.

We find even such co— operation as this in the
work of mere instinct. Take as illustration of
this the case of a little terrier which was found with
an undesired litter. All the pups but one were
drowned. In a few days it was decided to kill
that one also. It was removed, drowned, and
buried. With a desperate whine the little mother
roamed the garden half a day, discovered the place
of burial, exhumed the body, and when found had
actually licked and warmed it back to a fluttering
life. Here was a normal instinct working blindly
for the righting of wrong, without anger, without
despair, gently bringing life out of death by the
intensity of love and the outgoing of her own vital
warmth ; and it may be used as a spy-glass to show
us the whole instinctive world of gentle endeavour
toward fulness of life, as against the violence and
robbery of nature which we have too lightly
assumed to be also normal.

But to return. When creation becomes self-
conscious and intelligent, the most important
