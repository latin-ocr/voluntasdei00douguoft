There is no inorganic speck or crumb of this
solid earth, or of the sun or starS, that is not
moving within itself‚ that is not full of its own
motion and has not a behaviour of its own that
is affected by and in harmony with everything
else in the universe. Everything that is solid,
everything that is liquid, everything that is
gaseous——all these are built up or composed by
something we call chemical action, then scattered
or decomposed in the same way. Some of these
changes we can see going on every day; and
science tells us that the very stars are sometimes
dashed to pieces and form again. Then when we
come to what we call organic life, what does it
do? lt builds up various organic forms, and
these forms dissolve again. It used to be supposed
that matter was one thing and life another, and
no one has ever caught life apart from matter or
matter static3 what we call matter is always in
motion, always doing something. Whether it be
organic or inorganic, matter is now described in a
way that to the plain man seems to imply that it
is only a form of energy, the difference between
one solid and another being a difference in what is
called electrical tension. If matter be thought of
as a form of energy, energy may be thought of as
the body of life. Now, of course, we do not know
anything that can help us to explain the mystery of
creation, but let us try to conceive how it might be.

We are thinking of God as existing uncreated
and uncreating. If God acted He could not do
less than give. Let us suppose that in the be-
ginning creation was a gift. In becoming creator
