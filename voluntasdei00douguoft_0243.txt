xv1 CHRISTIAN POWER 211

unutterable joy of God, the joy of the only real
power, the joy of real conquest and always greater
conquest. What is conquered in this way is per-
manently righted‚ made permanently honourable,
permanently united to the conqueror; by any
other method what appears to be the conquest of
good is only a temporary extension of wrong.
This is identical with the gospel message. If in
any sense Jesus was the power of God, or revealed
the power of God, or indicated the power of God,
it is certain that in His victorious course Divine
Power does not strive nor cry, nor break the
bruised reed, nor quench the smoking wick, nor
punish according to desert. The difference between
men in whom the power of God is and is not opera—
tive is that the latter seek to subdue by violence
what the former actually subdue by love. The
ethic of the beatitudes is the reign of God.

The early Christians converted half the world
in the great impetus obtained by an absolute refusal
to recognise the current world-powers as the King-
dom of God. The world that represented God
was in the future3 it differed entirely from any-
thing actual; in it the civic virtues were to be
summed up in obedience to the Messiah who had
come “ not to be ministered unto, but to minister '’ ;
it was that same Messiah who, they believed, would
reign over thern. This was no new doctrine, but
a development of what had almost become trite as
the expression of exalted hours of religious in-
spiration. “Thus saith the high and lofty One
that inhabiteth eternity. . . . I will dwell with
him that is of a humble spirit'’ (Isa. lvii. 15).
