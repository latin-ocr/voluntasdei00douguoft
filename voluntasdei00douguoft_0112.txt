widely than the seedling from the plant, and at the
same time we get in the animal a second sort of
unity between one and two or more; to what
we may call the oneness of heredity 1s added com-

together and have community of life. We get
the hive, the herd, the flock, the pack. In these
communities of feeling and labour, to make one
angry is to make all angry3 to frighten one is to
frighten all ; to attract one is to attract all. And
in this connection we get also a greater possibility
of difference. If one animal in a herd or flock
incurs the displeasure of the rest, they will not
tolerate its existence3 they hunt it to death. Or
if there be one ruler of the herd, he will fight to
the finish with another who makes pretension to
his position.

In human beings we see the oneness of heredity
and the oneness of corporate purpose more strongly
exemplified. We also get a third degree of union,
with a greater degree of difference, between two
in the life-long bond of marriage. Some genera-
tions firther back, the two who find themselves in
perfect unity of life and purpose must have had a
common origin in order to possess sufficient one-
ness for such union, and we find in practice that
they must have had different parentage to possess
sufficient difference to make them attractive to one
another.

To these degrees of union must be added
another oneness which we might call the unity of
understanding. When two minds in communica-
