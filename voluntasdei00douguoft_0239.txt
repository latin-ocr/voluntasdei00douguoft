CHAPTER XVI

CHRISTIAN POWER

The “ will to power'' is divine, and is essential to humanity.

Jesus proclaimed the way of Divine meekness as the only way to attain true

ower.

Thpe scientist has discovered the method of meek obedience to be the only
way to power over nature 3 and the Gospel says the same method in social
life must bring about the reign of God.

Only by using the Divine method can men share the Divine joy of real power,
of permanent conquest.

In their absolute refusal to see in current world-powers the Kingdom of God
the early Christians converted half the world.

Love, and the service of love, have always been the culmination of the mystic
vision3 but the inconsistent belief that evil has to be first overthrown by
Divine violence has caused Christians in practice to modify the ethic of
Jesus, while the Kingdom tarries.

The Christians of the first century looked for the speedy coming of the new
order by the direct power of God.

Later the church learned that human co-operation with God was needed, but
in learning it lost sight of the main characteristic of her power and resorted
to violence.

The Crusades illustrate this.

The contradictory ideals thus involved were to be realised‚ the one as a
universal church on earth, to be fought for3 the other as a perfect state
in heaven, to be gained by the Christian temper.

Through long experience Christians are coming to see that the fighting spirit
must be dropped and the meekness of Jesus must conquer the world.

The practical problem is how to live in present conditions so as to bring in
the perfect state.

Parallel between the missionary in a non-Christian land and the early
Christians. Their common methods and common success suggest a way
of solving our problem.

Each generation must be ready to cast off elements of the current world as
it comes to recognise them as inconsistent with the Christian spirit.

The Christian attitude towards such questions as the use of the military to
keep order in a railway strike.

The mysterious power of the method of Jesus is evident to-day in the few
who consistently adhere to that method.

This power is inconsistent with fear.
