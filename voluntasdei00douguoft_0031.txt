SYNOPSIS xxvii

ι’Λιιιῡ
Neither from the teaching of our Lord nor from the trend of our
experience have we any assurance that all such erring per-
sonalities shall ultimately be saveul3 but our conception of
crentive purpose makes it necessary to believe that even if the
individual mind finally disintegrate, it will bc re-absorbetl into
the created life-force, to rise again through personality to union
with God.
As things are, the return to the normal onward path of every
erring soul is possible by saith in God's re-creative power.

CHAPTER x'x

SALvATioN ΒΥ ]ογ . . . . . . . 265

Christian repentance ought to be a glad thing.

It is no longer possible for us to suppose that God is partial 3 His
whole creation, whether progressive or retrograde, must have His
impartial favour.

God’s purpose being one, the perfection of the earthly state and
the ultimate perfection of humanity in a purely spiritual state
must be inter-dependent parts of that purpose.

Hence we need to cultivate both the outward and visible and the
inward and spiritual departments of life.

The long process of physical and social evolution points to a future
earthly state in which the law of God will be written in the
heart of man and of things.

But we cry for something earth can never give, and religious
experience brings ever stronger assurance that the joys of earth
are but steps to a more intense unearthly joy.

For the regulation of our life we need more explicitly to synthesise
the earthly and the spiritual goals.

The teaching of Christianity and of science, truly interpreted‚ seem
to encourage the belief that every step in an ascending progress
brings keener consciousness of the inter-dependence of the parts
of any whole, and that to live immortally unto God must be to
live unto all our fellows and they to us.

The thought that conceptions of material perfectiori and spiritual
perfectiori are incompatible is directly contradicted by what we
know of the fullest spiritual life, which will be found to best
adjust the outward and the spiritual in its purpose.

If our Lord affirmed a synthesis of both the earthly and the
heavenly hope never made before, His eschatology must have
been ill understood by His hearers. We are yet dazed by its
splendour.

Dante saw that a perfect earth must be part of God's scheme.

To sum up :

of His union with God, accept what befell Hirn in
fulfilling His mission and require His sollowers to make
