“ THE thing before men zoas a human lise, entirely native, and
unflinchingly complete. Its conditions were those of human
simplicity‚ mmdorned and undisguised. And yet it was undeniahle
that in the texture of human history a new thing had appeared.
Perstet stainlessness‚ perfect sureness of spiritual intuition‚ and as
it seemed of communion with the Unseen‚ a tone of unique and
un altering authority, contributed elements in an impression which
included, and was greater than, them all.

“ We who look back from such a distance, who have seen so
much crumhle and alter, who belong to a generation which has
changed everything‚ and which ftels itseff on the hrink offurther
change, who have seen the outer form and fabric of the religion in
which this living truth found body crached, and shaking‚ and dis-
figured‚ and as it may seem to many awaiting hy destruction the
end of its decay—we still find that one Natne is honoured above
every name.

“ Do we ask what explains this wonderful thing, what secret is
at the heart of all this ? Ah! there we are upon the very threshold
of the inner sanctina-y, and it is not for me to-day to enter there.
Only we may put to ourselves the question whether it may not he
that that old hinship between man and the Being‚ high and hely,
who in Nature is part revealea and part consented, that kinship
which is the secret osman's power to interpret Nature, which makes
all his hest moral effort seem to him to he hut a response and an
imitation—whether it may not be that that kinship has found at length
some new and full completion‚ a unity final, and yet infinitely
gerrninal.''—“The Fulness of Christ‚'' E. S. Talbot, Bishop of
Winchester.
