get another prevailing element, which again has
its place in that balance of faculties which ensures
persistence. Each addition produces apparent con-
fusion. When the life of the tribe is merged in
national life, we find this confusion repeated in
human consciousness. In the principle of selection
what was true of tribes was, it is clear, true also
ofindividuals. A weak body might be counter—
balanced by a strong will or keen understanding
or spiritual insight ; or any of these faculties might
be weak, and the man still wholesome enough to
be in the line of progress, to produce physical
offspring, or ideas, which should persist.

Now, if we interpret all this by the hypothesis

it is not defect that the immanent mind is aiming
at. The purpose suggested by the development
of life is health of body and mind, excellence of
the intelligence, excellence of the will-power,
excellence of the extra-regarding impulses which
make for the perfection of corporate life. The
defects which are incidentally handed down with
these excellences cannot be regarded as the result
of purpose, for the stream of tendency runs always,
as it were, through filter-beds, and the prevailing
desire of nature seems to be to rid itself of
defects.

Further, as it is complexity and balance that
seem to be aimed at, we cannot speak of the
perfection of simpler forms of life as an end, or
as belonging to the method, when they act as the
diseases of higher forms. They belong to the
method when they act as food for, or as scavengers
