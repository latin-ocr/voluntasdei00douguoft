free earthly creation to become, in co-operation with

every man's own salvation.

Faith, hope, charity, receive an enduring stimulus in the belief that
the very image, the very life of God is latent in all things and
is being evol-:ed from all thingS.

Because the Christian revelation shows God as opposed to all pain
and wrong, and shows Hirn as suffering in all pain and wrong,
the world is saved by the joyful realisation that God Himself is
its Saviour.

Christian repentance is the turning from all thought that in God
is any darkness at all.
