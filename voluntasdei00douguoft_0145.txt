for him. Here, then, we have every individual
upon earth partly made and wholly environed by
forces other than himself.

It is this great and undoubted fact that in the
ancient world caused the tradition of every man
of remarkable power to be accompanied by some
story which would adequately account for his pre-
natal superiority. Such a child is said to be a
heavenly foundling, or his earthly mother is
pictured as united to a god or demi—god, or he
comes of some great dynasty, with divine father-
hood farther back. The literature of the ancient
world teems with such stories‚ and they represented
a vital truth. The early Church, pushing its
way among civilised and half-civilised races, found
them everywhere. It was by a universal as well
as true instinct that Christians claimed for their
Master not only union with God‚ but divine
descent, and later added to that the humble
innocence and regal dignity of His earthly mother.
While there is much modern discussion as to
whether the doctrine of the Virgin Birth is founded
upon a mistaken or a true tradition, it is helpful
to realise how great a truth lies outside the range
of this controversy. If creation be divine in its
origin, not only does every terrestrial life come to
birth by a divinely appointed process, but indi—
vidual greatness must always be the result of some-
thing in the pre-natal circumstances that may be
truly described as special union with the Creative
Spirit. The preparation for a life of unique good-
ness must have been unique volitional union with

God .
