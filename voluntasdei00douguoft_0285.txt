stitution, and hope lies, not in fighting that which
menaces, but in radical improvement.

Further, if we believe that God suffers with
those we condemn or ostracise or punish, we
shall be sure that we must find some other solu—
tion to our problems of government. At the
expense of our own rights or our own dignity we
must find another way of winning thern, even as
He in Christ has won us. And we may be quite
sure that in winning them they will also win us.

To sum up. In the long process of evolution
the only side we can suppose God to have taken
is that involved in guiding life into higher forms
through the normal development of health and
strength, beauty and wisdom ; and we note, when
humanity is reached, the human heart instinctively
feels that God takes the side of the poor and
suffering. In exact counterpart of this we find in
the manifestation of God‘s character in our Lord
Jesus Christ that His activities were directed
towards health and sanity and the supply of the
normal needs of healthy life, that the poor and
the suffering and the ignorant were His first care :
and He adds to what evolution teaches us, to what
the instinct of the heart teaches US‚ that it is with
sinners also that God takes sides.

What we need to realise is that. while the King-
dom tarries there will always be something that
good men think wrong that is right, always
something that they think right that is wrong, and
that progress for us can only consist in learning
more and more perfectly to rely on the Power of

Love which is God.
