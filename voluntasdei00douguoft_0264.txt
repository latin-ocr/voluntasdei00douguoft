even the beginning of their operations‚ when,
stunned and broken by the collapse of all their

of their own fond expectations? We have the
record of certain commands—such as, eg„ to
cry everywhere that the Kingdom of heaven was

welcomed the cry would show, to accept the anger
and violence that it is in the nature of most men
to deal out to those who interfere with their
prejudices and preoccupations, the command not
to prepare their defence because it would be given
them to know what to say only in the hour of
need. Such simple expressions of the principles
on which they must act, together with the inward‚
wordless stimulus of the new life, sent them forward.

response to the need of the world was determined
by their own initiative, just as the subjugation of

age-long initiative of mankind. The hesitation
and divergence of the apostles upon essential
matters proves how much was left to their own
