combativeness could not, as far as they are good,
have been developed otherwise. As a matter of
fact cubs develop in mere play the faculties they
afterwards use in warfare. When we think of the
innumerable forms of animal life which might
have existed and do not, it would seem to lie with
those who consider violence necessary to show why
what has survived through violence ought to have
survived. There is no proof that a lion or any
other carnivorous beast ought to exist 3 there is no
proof that the vegetarian, non-combative lion of
apocalyptic vision could not exist; but there is
absolute proof that if any lion were not gentle with
his own cubs he could not exist. Further, if he
were not gentle with his mate, and on the whole
and in the main peaceable with his fellow animals, he
could not exist. If he killed his prey indiscrimi-
nately, whether he needed food or not, he would
exterminate thern and so himself perish. It is true
that many of the present powers of violent animals
could not have developed without combativeness,
but it is also true that violent animals and pests are
in the near future doomed to extinction. Unless we
are prepared to maintain that whatever is, is neces-
sary—our sins included—we have no reason to
insist that to be combative and carnivorous are
necessary to life; but the gentleness, large toler—
ance, and self-sacrifice displayed in all animal life,
even the fiercest, are certainly necessary. They are
its main characteristics, the very characteristics by
which any species doniinates another, for they
are necessary to its health, growth, and multiplica-
tion.
