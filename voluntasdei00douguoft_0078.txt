sufficient order in physical force to cause all men
to admit that it may be perfectly ordered by
supreme Mind for some supreme purpose. But
there is no indication of what the beginning or end
of that purpose may be. Apart from organic life
the docile, calculable, inorganic world seems dead.
Yet we are often forced, when we least expect it,
to suspect that the poetry of motion, of light and

inorganic. nature, is not our fiction, but something
that impinges on reality only in a lesser degree
than organic life itself‚ and 1s consequently akin to
life, not to death.

When organic life appears upon the scene, we
perceive a force more feeble according to mechanical
standards, but which evinces a new complexity and
a higher order of progress. It seems to have a
greater degree of autonomy. Its every individual
form and movement is unique, and it possesses
a capacity for developing from one form to another
——from frond to leaf, from moss to tree. Whether
life adapts itself to its environment, or whether the
