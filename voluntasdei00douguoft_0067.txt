ῃ CREATIVE PURPOSE 35

The thing that bulks largest in our idea of the
universe is always matter. The fact that the
universe is material seems at once the most evident
and the most important observation that we make
about it. The earth, the air, the ether, the sun,
the planets, the stars——these are all alike material ;
for all that we know about them is that they
behave in a calculable way ; and the ways in which
they behave themselves we call the laws of inorganic
matter. There are other and different ways of
behaviour‚ and these ways we call the laws of
organic matter. A tree, for example, grows up
in spite of the pull of gravitation which, if it were
not alive, would keep it to the level of the earth.
We know that all matter, organic and inorgafflc,
is constantly changing. In this respect the
difference between the thing that seems most dead
and that which seems most alive, may be compared
to the difference between 3 leaping, rapid stream
or dashing waterfall and 3 glacier. Both are fluid,
both are on the way to water the plains of earth.
The stream leaps and dashes at the rate, let us
say, of 3 mile in five minutes‚ and a glacier moves,
say, at the rate of an inch in five years. Every
particle of our bodies changes, I understand, in a
few years. Our tables and fire—irons and earthen-
ware may be handed down from generation to
generation intact; but where are the tables‚ fire-
irons, and earthenware of a thousand years ago?
or of the Roman period? Except in case of rare
preservation they are dissolved into their own
material elements as the matter in our bodies more

quickly is dissolved.
