x1 DIVINE-HUMAN REVELATION μμ)

and the individual, always in himself more or
less defective, can only rise higher as the psychic
environrnent rises higher. Of human societies the
highest forms seem to be those that transcend local
and temporary boundaries, like the great religions.
Only a religion can transcend such boundaries,
because in relating men to each other it draws the
relating line, not direct from man to man, but, as
it were, round the throne of heaven. It follows,
then, that when the human will became perfectly
united to the divine, the inspired subject of this
union‚ ἷζε. the Christ, would found a great religion.

It has been well said that religion, if it be any-
thing, must be everything3 but it is everything
looked at in a certain order and proportion, and
the religion founded by the ideal man must intro-
duce a better proportion and order into man's
way of regarding life, and this order must be that
which will best enable men to co—operate with
the Creator in lifting up their own race, and the
whole of terrestrial creation, into conformity with
His desire. We should certainly expect the right
order to set first in importance the universal weal ;
secondly, the racial weal; and, thirdly‚ the weal
of the individual.

Let us proceed to consider the attitude of
Christianity toward these three ends, taking them
in reverse order, as man in practice must always do.
