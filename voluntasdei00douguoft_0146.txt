lf we go back to the Hebrew version of one of
the great poems of creation-—that in the first chapter
of our Bible, we find God represented as ordaining
that every species should be organised with its seed
‘in itself’' ; and when that is brought forth God
is represented as rejoicing over it, saying that it
is “good’' It is impossible to read the whole
passage without seeing that in this author's mind
the beauty of terrestrial creation consisted in the
“breeding true '' of each species of organic life,
and that to his mind this was the result of the
brooding of the Spirit of God upon terrestrial
creation. We moderns cannot believe in creative
purpose at all without perceiving how true and
powerful is the insight of the great poet. But to
him the whole process of creative evolution was
foreshortened; he looked backw ard and saw its facts
as we see a telescope through which we look, as ring
and lens only when it is, 1n fact, a long series of
tubes and lenses. When we come to the later
Hebrew prophets‚ we find them looking at the
creative purpose, not in the past but in the
future, · and again they see God in action, bring—
ing forth good out of good and evil out of evil;
but again they see the whole series of events
as one event, the whole process of development
as a crisis of salvation. Indeed, the human mind’ s
eye requires long training before it can estimate
distance or take any note of all that lies between
it and the object of attention. The human race
for long centuries always saw what it thought to be
intensely real as immediately before it, just as the
individual infant will stretch out its hand to grasp
