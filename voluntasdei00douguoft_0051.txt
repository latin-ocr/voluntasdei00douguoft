CHAPTER Ι

QUALITIES OF PUR POSE

Belief in creative Intelligence involves belief in creative purpose. The con-
ditious under which we seek truth require us to make the facts we know
the basis of inference as to the nature of G011's purpose.

The qualities of purpose considered in concrete life——

1. purpose exercisecl between precise forecast and exact fulfilment.
This only possible for the mere mechanic working in inanimate
matter.

2. Inventor or artist works out new ideal in inanimate matter. Fore-
cast less precise3 result less accurate.

3. Gardeners and herdsmen work out inward ideals in the material of
life. These desire only the perfection of the life they tend, with-
out forecasting individual variation.

4. The schoolmaster‚ parent, or missionary works out inward ideals in
a higher form of life. The higher the material in thch the
purpose must be worked out, the stronger and nobler must be the
purpose.

This is the law of purpose3 and we may infer from it that God executes
His purpose in the sphere of autonomous life, that the ‹livine Will is
not a force that works mechanically between precise forecast and exact

fulfilment.
