is of its essence.

We shall all admit this to be true of the organic
life of vegetation; and when we come to the life
that moves about for food and shelter, we see that
in those strains which develop into higher forms

they can immediately go to war. There is a stage
in which all such animals are gentle and must

is not thus essential to life in general at any stage,
though almost all animals can be violent. The ox,

their highest perfection without going to war.
We have no more reason to suppose scarcity,

to be normal, or the will of God, in instinctive
life than they are in intelligent life ; but we know
that life could not progress without an ever-
lengthening period of gentleness and tender care.

We ought to be quite clear about gentleness
as a distinction of all organic life. We have heard
