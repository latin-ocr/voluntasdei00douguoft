we believe in the law of the conservation of life-
energy and the splendid goal to which it moves,
this faith does not contradict the belief that it is
possible for life, when it has attained even to the
complex height of sels—conscious choice, to fall
back into lower forms. If individual spirit is
immortal so far as to be independent of the death
of the body, it probably endures through vaster
processes before it can fall back into the condition
of the latent life-force.

Now, if this be the case, and if all terrestrial life
be one, and every part of life have more or less
influence upon the whole, we can discover, in the
persistence of spirits which continue in the lower
choice, what must be a diabolic element in human
life. Thus we may think of individual man on
earth as under the attraction, not only of divine
Love, but of all those human spirits, in this life
and beyond, that have gravitated as it were toward
divine Love, and also under the influence of all
those spirits which, in this life and beyond, in
defiance of divine Love, are sweeping backwards
to lose themselves again where the river of life
flows in its more elemental condition, and in their
sweep exercising their own power of attraction,
their own infernal telepathic suction‚ upon the
sons of earth and, for aught we know, upon the
immortal whole of humanity.

It is reasonable to suppose that the influence
of both these forces is felt, consciously or un-
consciously, by every man ; but the degree of his
consciousness of them and of their difference, his
natural affinity with one or the other, is determined
