concrete translation. The utmost activity of trial
and error, of meditation, of enterprise and initia—
tion‚ is required of us before the inspiration can be
translated into concrete life. St. Paul’s “Then
shall I know even as also I have been known‚''
“that I may apprehend that for which also I was
apprehended‚'' suggest the necessary questioning
attitude of the human mind towards the mystic
vision. Only by trying and failing and trying
again can mankind push forward in any quest,
acquiring thus more and more fully at every step
the attributes of life—humility, persistente in enter-
prise‚ and originality ; and Christianity‚ if it is the
fullest life, must obey the same law.

Why are we commonplace? Why is our
piety stereotyped. Ρ W hy do our alms—deeds follow
one another in barren conformity? Because our
religious spontaneity is wrapped in a napkin,
buried in the ground. We are half dead from
fear of a hard God ; we are afraid of high failure,
and imagine God is better pleased with the low,
paltry success of giving Him back the life He
gave us untainted by error or folly or failure,
without gain—without newness or novelty of
personal life to delight God, without the multiplied
product of spiritual enterprise. If the gospel
teaches us anything it is that God is guarantor
for all the human effort that makes for good of
any sort, however great its apparent failure. The
gates of hell shall not prevail against what is good,
because the overcoming of evil is the contest of
God; God cannot be God without rising victor
out of contest. The Incarnation is the guarantee
