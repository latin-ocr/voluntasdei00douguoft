have in the early history of Christianity a very
vivid presentation of transition between the early
conception of the salvation to be wrought by the
Christ and a later conception.

First, the disciples go out to cry the advent
of the Kingdom. The Jesus they know is a
Jewish prophet, and the Kingdom which was
coming from God was to bring to the elect ot
the Jewish nation exemption from that national
dishonour and disintegration under which they
were writhing. Jerusalem is the centre of their
world, and the elect of the Jewish nation the
nearest kin of God. They do not regard the
sacrifice of their Master as necessary to the cul—
mination they preach.

Later, after the resurrection we have this same
conception but deepened and widened. The disciples
still come to the risen Lord asking, “Wilt thou
now restore the Kingdom to Israel?'' but they
now believe that the Jesus whom they knew is
the heaven-sent Deliverer, and that it had behoved
Him to suffer shame and death for the salvation
of the elect, and that the elect must also fill up
what was behind of His sufferings in order to
obtain future exemption from dishonour and
suffering. Jerusalem is still the centre of the
world, and the Jews are still nearest of kin to
God.

Later still, after hesitation, discussions and dis-
putes, the elect among the Gentiles are found
to be on an equality with the elect among the
Jews as to nearness to God. Jerusalem, which
has fallen, is no longer the centre of the world.
