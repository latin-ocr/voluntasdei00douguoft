that make it what it is. We cannot think of such
dissolution as the perfecting of the star.

It is not only in our physical relations to the race
that we are one with it. Our spiritual powers are
dormant until they are evoked by personal relations
to our kind. We can, of course, suppose that our
spirits existed before this life‚—a view for which
there seems little evidence, and which on the whole
raises more difficulties than it solves,—but in that
case the social unity of humanity has pre-existence
as well as after-existence, for there can be no
question that it is only in our dealings with one
another that we possess our souls. Dim is the
light that gravitation as a symbol can throw on
this subject, but we all know that in the world of
spirit or mind one mind has a pull on other minds‚
and experiences their pull.

This force, little as we know about it, is
certainly not chiefly important in its occasional
or abnormal manifestations‚ as when one mind
suddenly falls under the power of another, or is
abnormally enslaved to another3 its chief import-
ance is that it is the force that keeps every mind
an integer. The importance of gravitation is not
shown in such individual facts as the fall of a
meteorite, but in its causing every body to retain
its form and relations. And we certainly have
evidence that the more the human being endeavours
to hold himself isolated and independent of all
other minds‚ the more is the self liable to disin-
tegrate‚ and that even more miserably than when
normal sels-direction is exchanged for direction by
the random influence of the mob-spirit. It
