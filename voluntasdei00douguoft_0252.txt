if they be Christians, as the will of God. The

other sort of men consent to use the power of
arms in such a case as the best that can be at the
moment, convinced that the best is sorry work,
that the need for coercion ought not to exist, and
that a state that is not pushing on to something

ignorance and vice will no longer exist, is already
doomed to destruction.

The same action is thus consistent with diver-

Among those who hold the last-named view
there are some who believe that the power of God
in Christ will soon bring about this better state of
things, and they rest not day nor night in their
efforts to bring it about. Among these faithful,
unresting workers there are some who are con-
vinced that they must do this work only by
methods of gentleness, crushing the fighting spirit
“like a vice of blood upon the threshold of the
mind,’' generously imputing only high motives to
their opponents, joyfully sacrificing all that they
have and are in working out the Christian ideals.
Such men as these last do not need warfare to give
them ennobling purpose, to teach them sels-sacrifice
and heroism‚ to exercise their nobler impulses or
the thews and sinews of their physical frame.
Their heroism‚ their power of brotherhood, their
very physical force, is on a higher plane, as
we well know. They not only deny the current
world, but affirm that the kingdom at hand is the
Kingdom of God and of His Christ ; while at the

same time they are more loyal to all that is good
