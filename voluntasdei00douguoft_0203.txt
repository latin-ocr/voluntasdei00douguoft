χιιι THE WEAL OF SPECIES OR RACE 171

exists as truly as its present. It is not possible
to break the continuity of the movement of life
that flows from father to son toward the future
perfection of the human race on earth; and
every individual part of that movement must,
if it continue to live as an individual beyond
death, continue the relation to the whole that
it once had, or cease to exist according to its
kind. Apart from the race the individual would
disintegrate and the liberated energy pass into
another form. All the evidence we have con-
cerning humanity is that man exists only in
relation to the human race ; if he lost that relation
he would cease to be man. Thus we have reason
to believe that, wherever his spirit goes, so long
as it exists as a human force it must so exist by
virtue of its relation to the race.

I might illustrate the relation of individual
spirits to their race beyond this life by the force
of gravitation. Science suggests to our imagina-
tion the conception of our physica] universe as
revolving about itself within limits defined, although
science has no means as yet of defining them ; that
is to say, we are bidden to conceive of a huge,
transparent, lens-shaped universe, hanging in space,
within which suns with all their satellites revolve
round sunS, and all revolve round some common
centre; and within this vast circumference the
laws of motion produce harmony of motion. If
any star of this universe should shoot out beyond
all range of the force we call gravitation, it would
cease to exist as a star; for it is its own inertia
and the pull of gravitation that hold it together,
