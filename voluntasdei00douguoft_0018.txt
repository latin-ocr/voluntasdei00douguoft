CHAPTER VII

NEWNEss OF Lm: . . . . . . . 89

susceptibility to God's influence develops with the growing God-
consciousness.

Illustration--the sea breaking into a new inlet.

Communion of God and man may be described as “telepathic.'’

Union of man with God does not mean identity. True union
depends on community of kind and difference of identity.

We rarely see anything perfect after its kind. Degree of perfection
in plants or animals depends on environment. Whatever the
general level reached by a class or species, it will respond to an
improved environment.

So with the human race. Hence the function of the most God-
conscious man must be to better the social environment of his
fellows.

To describe this function in another way: the highest human
work is creative3 and the highest material for this work is con-
scious autonomous life, and the highest product is a new humanity.
The greatest men will, therefore, always be working to create
new men and a new human environment.

Thus the greatest rnen have been founders of world religions which,
in proportion to their greatness‚ transcend local and national

barriers.
But while any society is still imperfect, human excellence, which

must be God's intention, cannot be perfectly realised in it.

The highest development possible to the individual in an imperfect
environrnent can only be perfectiori of volition.

When this is attained by the founder of a religion the result must
be a society that will transcend all human distinctions.

CHAPTER VIII
SON oF MAN . . . . . . . . 99

Man everywhere has the inward conviction that he could do right
but does not.

On the basis of this conviction all law and justice rest.

It would seem natural that this sense of ability to do right should

find realisation.
The man who attained to perfect volition would be the true Son of

the race.
If rightness of will involves compassion manward, such an one

must sympathise with the shortcoming of his race.
Such rightness of will involves “singleness of eye‚” which is the
way of divine illumination.
