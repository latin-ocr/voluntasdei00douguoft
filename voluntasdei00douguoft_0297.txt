CHAPTER XX

SALVATION BY JOY

Christian repentance ought to be a glad thing.

lt is no longer possible for us to suppose that God is partial3 His whole
mention, whether progressive or retrograde, must have His impartial
favour.

God’s purpose being one, the perfection of the earthly state and the ultimate
perfectiori of humanity in a purely spiritual state must be inter-dependent
parts of that purpose.

Hence wc need to cultivate both the outward and visible and the inward and
spiritual departments of life.

The long process of physical and social evolution points to a future earthly
state in which the law of God will be written in the heart of man and of
things.

But we cry for something earth can never give, and religious experience
brings ever stronger assurance that the joys of earth are but steps to a
more intense unearthly joy.

For the regulation of our life we need more explicitly to synthesise the
earthly and the spiritual goals.

The teaching of Christianity and of science, truly interpreted‚ seem to
encourage the belief that every step in an ascending progress brings keener
consciousness of the inter-dependence of the parts of any whole, and that
to live immortally unto God must be to live unto all our fellows and they
to us.

The thought that conceptions of material perfectiori and spiritual perfection
are incompatible is directly contradicted by what we know of the fullest
spiritual life, which will be found to best adjust the outward and the spiritual
in its purpose.

If our Lord affirmed a synthesis of both the earthly and the heavenly
hope, never made before, His eschatology must have been ill understood
by His hearers. We are yet dazed by its splendour.

Dante saw that a perfect earth must be part of God’s scheme.

To sum up :

(a) The Christian doctrine that Jesus must needs, by reason of His
union with God, accept what befell Him in fulfining His mission,
and require His followers to make the sarne sacrifice, reflects
the thesis that the Creator is in part “despised and rejected of

men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief” in His
creation.
