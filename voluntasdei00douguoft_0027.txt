CHAPTER XVI

The “will to power'' is divine, and is essential to humanity.

Jesus proclaimed the way of Divine meekness as the only way to
attain true power.

The scientist has discovered the method of meek obedience to be
the only way to power over nature3 and the Gospel says the
same method in social life must bring about the reign of God.

Only by using the divine method can men share the divine joy of
real power, of permanent conquest.

In their absolute refusal to see in current world-powers the Kingdom
of God the early Christians converted half the world.

Love, and the service of love, have always been the culmination of
the mystic vision, but the inconsistent belief that evil has to be
first overthrown by Divine violence has caused Christians in
practice to modify the ethic of Jesus, while the Kingdom tarries.

The Christians of the first century looked for the speedy coming
of the new order by the direct power of God.

Later the Church learned that human co-operation with God was
needed, but in learning it lost sight of the main characteristic of
her power and resorted to violence.

The Crusades illustrate this.

The contradictory ideals thus involved were to be realised‚ the one
as a universal Church on earth, to be fought for3 the other as
a perfect state in heaven, to be gained by the Christian temper.

Through long experience Christians are coming to see the fighting
spirit must be dropped and the meekness of Jesus must conquer
the world.

The practical problem is how to live in present conditions so as to
bring in the perfect state.

Parallel between the missionary in a non—Christian land and the
early Christians. Their common methods and common success
suggest a way of solving our problem.

Each generation must be ready to cast off elements of the current
world as it comes to recognise them as inconsistent with the
Christian spirit.

The Christian attitude towards such questions as the use of the
military to keep order in a railway strike.

The mysterious power of the method of Jesus is evident to-day in
the few who consistently adhere to that method.

The life Jesus came to give was a positive, energising force3 and
the Church would have better represented her Lord had she
emphasised positive rather than negative commandments.
