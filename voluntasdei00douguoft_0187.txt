environment. The environment and the inner life
are so closely inter-related that it is impossible to
make any statement about one that does not involve

the other.
Again, processes of selection and growth can

never be instantaneous. All rose cuttings, all
young cattle, could instantaneously be put in a
perfect garden or a perfect pasture‚ but the sur—
roundings would cease to be perfect for the healthy
the moment the feeble or diseased were placed in
them. As long as there is defect or disease in
roses or cattle, vigilance and selection would first
be necessary, and even when nothing but fit young
life is placed in perfect environment time is still
necessary for the interaction oflife and environment

to produce growth.

It is quite obvious, then, that were we convinced
that the perfect environment of human nature
would come, like the shifting of stage scenery,
to-morrow‚ this would involve the corresponding
conviction that men were ready to manifest an inner
life corresponding to the perfect outvvard condi-

life had already determined excellent conditions for
itself. This is the natural paradox involved in the
coming of the kingdom. Our next work is to
discover what are the characteristics of the inner
life that will determine its own perfect environ-
