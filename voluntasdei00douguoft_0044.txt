of life in which resides all the wisdom that con-

elephant of natural law and mechanical sequence
is standing upon the tortoise of the spontaneous
life spirit, whose inadequate power either to know
precisely what it would be at or to work its will in
recalcitrant matter is only too obvious.

If we insist upon conceiving a more adequate
cause for the universe as it is, and postulate a
good God with a purpose such as we can in part
understand, we cannot by that means get away

of the universe shows no bias such as we count
divine, and that life in its wild profusion disports
itself in many irrelevant, absurd, and abominable
forms. The traditional doctrine that all things
happen according to God's will becomes more and
more difficult.

Ι think that, even apart from religious doctrine,
the greater number of men will continue to believe
in the hypothesis of divine Intelligence‚ because life
does not explain mechanism, nor does mechanism

requires a divine Understandiiig to combine both.

Life is, after all, an experience and not a
theory3 the theorists are few, the living are many.
The ordinary man is so accustomed every hour of

power of mind can remove, that he naturally refers
all that humanity recognises as beyond its powers
