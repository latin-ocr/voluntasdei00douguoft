CHAPTER XV

WORLD AFFIRMATION

Those beliefs which account to a man for existence are his real creed.
When any saith censes to do this for men it ceases to be a living religion.

A religion rnay be genninely adhered to which is not a key to existence, but
it is a dying religion.

The Pharisaic religion in the time of Christ is an instance.

The permanent element in religion is the effort of each age to reconcile
religious feeling and knowledge.

The central Christian doctrines must be felt to offer the most fundamental
explanation of the facts of existence as we know them to-‹lay if Christi-
anity is to continue a vital religion and not become a mere mythology.

The conception of the work of Christ developed in the early Church as the
possession of new facts required it.

The fact that Christian saith has always been able to assimilate new know-
ledge, and re-read the Christian revelation in its light, suggests that
Christianity originates in an external Power, not in man.

There is no stopping-place in this process of development as facts call for a
more fundamental explanation.

The discovery in our times of the relative insignificance of our world in the
astronomical universe demands a deeper interpretation of the meaning of
Christ's earthly life and death.

Consider how the conception of the union of the divine and the human
natures in Christ is affected by modern conceptions of Divinity and
humanity.

No longer able to suppose God concentrates care on this little earth, we
cannot suppose we know as much of what there is to know about Him as
before. Our case is like that of a child in the nursery when he begins to
find out that his father, though devoted to his interests, has wider interests
of which a child can know nothing.

Agaln, humanity being but an incident in world evolution, and God being
involved in all material creation, the older conception of the human spirit
as wholly independent after death of the physical universe and of other
grades of life, is not tenable. Rather‚ co-operation with God in a future
life would seem to consist in doing what we see He has always been
doing for creation, and fitness for that must be attained here in the effort
to re-create earth.

In the light of these new conceptions of Divinity and humanity the Incarna—
tion must manifest the relation of God not merely to men, but to the
whole living creation, of which man is but a part.

We conceive the Atonement of Christ as manifesting God as working and
suffering to bring man with His whole living creation into free obedience
to His will, until it fully express the character He first conceived for it.
