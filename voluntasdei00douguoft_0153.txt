sees God most adequately revealed in a Person,
ever—living, ever-loving‚ ever-active toward US‚
his Godward vision is not more indirect than that
of any other thinking or unthinking man. In so

through the medium, but from God's union
With the medium. Itis, as it meets the con-
scioumess, truly God; just as the bearn of sun—
light that falls on us is truly sun, though we only
see the photosphere. Beam, photosphere, and
sun may be taken as an analogy for the doctrine
of the Trinity. Both bearn and photosphere are
in their nature very sun of very sun. How little
We know of the sun science tells us 3 but we have
good reason to believe that if the photosphere
were removed, We could not look upon the sun
and live.
