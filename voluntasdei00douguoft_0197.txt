xl1 INDIVIDUAL WEAL 165
or help God, there I think it will be found that

whatever the concomitant intellectual brilliancy,
human progress is in a cul de sac. Setting this
conclusion from history beside our belief—based
on the assumption of God as good and man as
free—that the Creator must suffer, as well as
rejoice, in the endurance of an autonomous crea-
tion, we come to see that some generous response
on man 's part to the ideal of Omnipotence sul-'ter-
ing from human cruelty is a condition of man ‘s
more permanent development—the fourth sign
of his fitness to survive, or of his capacity to
respond to the perfect environment‚ or, in our
Lord's phrase, to “ enter the Kingdom.''

If, then, one could believe that the perfection
of life conditions‚ the absolute reign of God’s
will, could come about catastrophically to-morrow,
it would seem necessary to believe to-day that men
were in existence ready to evince the signs of fullest
life we have just reviewed. If on the other hand
we believe that the reign of God shall become
absolute and universal—until all that God dis-
approves is destroyed, all that He approves is
established—till then, however long or short the
time, these characteristics must increasingly possess
those who shall be able to stand in that day.

Individual weal, then, by our interpretation ot
the process of evolution, must consist in the ex—
ercise and growth of these characteristics, and we
find them to be the chief characteristics that,
according to the teaching of Christ, are the con—
ditions of that repentance to which the only term
set was the coming of the Kingdom.
