CHAPTER IV

THE PURPOSE IN HUMANITY

Since God gave autonomy to His mention, He must have power to realise
His purpose by that method.

As “faithful Creator '' He must be related to His creation (1) by accepting
the struggle between right and wrong as His own, (z) by thus ensuring a
compensating gain to creation for all the suffering entailed by free-dom.

We have found that in organic nature the stream of life discards dise-‘ise and
defect and failure in intelligence. in temperance and courage, in affection
for offspring and co-operation with fellows.

In human affairs progress is more complex. conscience, or satisfaction in
virtue, seems to belong to the fullest force of human life. Life—sonna,
abundant, beautiful—does not flow along the generations of those who
break through customs to gratify passion3 it flows along the generations
of the law-abiding, but also of those who disregard present law in the effort
to mould and obey the higher law of the future.

The push of conscience must be seen not only in the will, but in the
understanding.

Along this line we get the growth of the hope in social progress or personal
immortality or both.

This is exemplified in the history of the human race. Nations with a
religion of pessimisin and fear show powers of accurate observation and
vivid imaginati0n; but advance in political justice and social amelioration
are only found with those who hope in the future.

This hope develops intellect. Thus, intellectual as well as moral force is
found necessary to fulness of life. A hopeful intellectual life makes for
universal fellowship. Monopolies always yield to the advance of a fuller
life.

Perfection of conscious life is to be manifested in physical health and beauty,
mental genius and social love.

But the individual dies imperfect.
The perfect fulfilment of every individual life seems involved in any purpose

of the universe worthy to be called divine.

As death and desuetude of ideas attach to any divine purpose we can detect
here, we are driven to produce the line of hope beyond this world, towards
a synthesis of individual and racial immortality.
