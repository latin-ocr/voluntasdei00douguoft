m UNION OF GOD WITH CREATION 87

whole of his rational life, is always liable to bc
drawn off from the various objects that distract it
and summed up in effort after a closer unity. The
appetites of the body are efforts to assimilate what
is not itself3 the efforts of the understanding have
the same motive 3 and what we call man's spiritual
nature, that faculty which has developed in him
by the exercise of his powers in seeking a response
from the unseen, weighs the results of appetite
and of knowledge, and finds them wanting. Man
feels himself, knows himself, capable of being a
party to a more perfect union with what is not
himself than earthly affection and knowledge can
give, and in one aspect we may say that the search
for this constitutes his whole religious history. In
another aspect we may believe that while he was
yet a great way off, Creative Wisdom ran forth to
meet him, so that it is not by desire and by the
efforts born of desire alone that he grows, but by
the satisfaction of each limited and imperfect
human desire for union, by the completion of
each human effort born of desire, by the answer-
ing care and the re-creative influence of the Creative

Love.
