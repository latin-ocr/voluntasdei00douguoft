xvi VOLUNTAS DEI

Again‚ if we take the “fruits of the Spirit‘' and their opposite as
described by St. Paul, we see that only in a community or family

where the fruits exist and their opposites are absent, can the
best sort of child be born.

Whether‚ then, the doctrine of the divine Fatherhood of Jesus be

fact, or only 3 poetic representation of fact, the idea it symbolises
is still true.

If the Incarnation was the culmination of the world-process, it
could only be the beginning of 3 saving lise3 further, that life, if
truly human, must go on to develop in the heavens. For true
humanity implies much more than 3 body in human shape in-
habited by Divinity 3 it involves a personal immortality.

This asserted in the Pauline doctrine of the resurrection and
mediation of Christ.

The Church now admits she has mistaken crisis for process in her
doctrine of the first, and also of the last, things. The Church

may also have mistaken crisis for process in her account of the
Advent of Christ.

But he who sees truth and mistakes its form lives more wisely than
he who fails entirely to see it.

Sun, photospherC, and sunbeam suggested as an analogy for the
doctrine of the Trinity.

C H A P T E R X
OMNIPOTENCE

The simplest idea of omnipotcnce is analogous to the power of an
adult over 3 child.

This power rnay be analysed into three sorts in an ascending scale—

1. Power to change the place of matter, i.e. to move the
child's body.

z. Power to influence the child's behaviour.

3. Power to conceive of the effect desired.

The effect desired may be (α) mere acquiescence3 or (h) intelli-
gent acquiescence5 or (c) a good balance of spontaneity and
acquiescence.

Power may also be reckoned quantitatively. The power that lasts
longest and extends over the greatest range is the greatest degree
of power.

Government by force can belong only to the infancy of the child
or of the race.

A clear conception of a strong character to be moulded, and self-
restraint in the process of evoking it, mark the highest degree
of power in the adult over a child.

If to this were added the power to create the child, we should get
the complete notion of creative and administrative power which
we associate with Omnipotence.
