xvx CHRISTIAN POWER 217

power where they are at home in countries nomin-
ally Christian. At home, their church edifices are
rather becoming more empty than more full, and
the surrounding population to which they ought
to minister holds aloof, uncomprehended and
uncomprehending. The foreign missionary is
like the early Christian in this respect—he is sure
that the world in which he labours——the current
system of customs and laws, of commercial un-
scrupulousness and politica] compromise and mili-
tary violence-—is doomed; a new re‘gime, which
he calls Christianity, is to take its place. He
pays his tax, asse. he conforms‚ as far as need be,
with law and custom3 he does not arbitrarily
interfere with widespread evils in civic and military
life 3 but his whole enthusiasm is given to building
up men, believing that these in their turn will rear
sons to be pillars in a new commonwealth whose
builder and maker is God. Here we get the
recognition, not only that the ideal kingdom is
at hand, but that it is to be brought about with
human co-operation.

Again, the missionary in a non-Christian country
to-day resembles the early Christian in that he
cannot, even if he would, use might to enforce
what he believes to be right. He cannot call in
the police ; he cannot use the bitter word to beat
up party spirit into big majorities; it would be
futile for him to insult those who oppose him
by publicly attributing to them the worst of
motives3 still less can he bring to bear any form
of physical revenge. However narrow and bigoted
he may be, however uncharitable he may naturally
