1 90 VOLUNTAS DEI

If man knows by experience that God in Christ thus deals with him, then
we have reason to think the larges creation of which man is so intimate
a part will also, by the patient love and suffering of God, ultimately be
conformed perfectly to His will.

The difficulty considered of holding that man's spirit is a special and more
direct creation of God, and that, therefore, the revelation through Christ
bears only on man's spiritual nature.

The modern philanthropic spirit can only be justified to the Christian by
seeing in it an attempt to work as God works to redeem the whole
terrestrial creation.
