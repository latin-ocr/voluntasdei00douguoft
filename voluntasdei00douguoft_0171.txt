CHAPTER XI

THE DIVINE-HUMAN REVELATION

The facts of the universe are a parable from which we must abstract a
meaning.

But only that interpretation which has been thoroughly assimilated can be
perfectly articulate. When articulate it is a less perfect interpretation
than that to which the mind is already advancing.

We dimly see in the creative process the Source of life, the developing life,
and the relation of potential unity between them.

The nature of the Source is indicated by the quality of the development——
energy into life, life into sels-hood.

Illegitimate anthropomorphism perhaps consists in assuming that what we
know as self-hood reveals the absolute nature of the Source.

It is because the Incarnation indicates vital union with the Source notwith-
standing our ignoranoe, that it is of such vast importance.

What should we expect the revelation to be that came to and through one
whose human will was perfectly united to the divine will ?

1. That he would reveal more truly the nature of God in His relation
to creation—God as the supreme lover of humauity, the supreme
sufferes with humanity, and the supreme attraction of humanity.

z. That he would reveal more truly the results of the divine influence
on the world, laying emphasis on the repairing of disaster, ‘⁴ binding
up that which is broken‚” “ healing that which is sick.''

This activity of the Creator, when applied to free, sels-conscious mind, pro-
duces the higher social development of the individual by means of a
higher social environrnent. The highest and most universal of human
societies are the great religions; hence we should expect the Christ to
found a great religion.

The religion founded by the ideal man will bring into man's way of seeing
life that order and proportion which best enables him to co-operate with
the Creator in lifting up the human race and all creation to conformity
with the Divine desire.

We should expect that order to set first the universal weal 3 next, the racial
weal; and, lastIy, the individual weal. In the next chapters we shall con-
sider the attitude of Christianity to these three ends, taking thern in the
order in which practically men have to face them.
