with the mental act of seeing. It has not proved
possible for us to form any conception of how
these changes in the brain are connected with the
consciousness of sight3 but we know that when
the brain is injured in this part there is no correct-
ness of vision. The sense of hearing, the sense

is imparted to it by the organ of sense, and what
we call the psychological powers of the higher
animals and man are seen to emerge in the precise
order and degree in which their organs and brains
develop. From one point of view we may say
that all the psychic powers of life are called forth
by the environment in which the life grows3
looking at it in another aspect we may say that
organic life has within it the potential psychic
