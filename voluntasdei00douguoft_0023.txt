SYNOPSIS xix

iuna-2

Only as regards moral imperfectiori does man feel he could have
done better, while history emphasises the attainment of moral
perfection in one instance.

A perfect environment is necessary for a perfect life, but life
determines its own environment.

The one morally perfect man proclaimed a new environment.

The necessity for interziction of perfect outer conditions and perfect
inner life in order to perfection is also seen in animal and plant
life.

Processes of selection and growth are never instantancous.

So if perfect environment came to-morrow all men or some men
must be ready to manifest a corresponding perfection of inner life
if the perfect condition is to be permanent.

All students of the Gospels admit that Jesus proclaimed the
coming of a perfect environment——the Kingdom of God, and
also proclaimed the life of the Kingdom already present in
the hearts of some men, and gave the signs by which it could be
known.

In view of one divine purpose through all things, we shall look
for correspondence of those signs described by Jesus with the
characteristics of fullest life in evolutionary development.

Main distinctions between inorganic and organic life :

1. Organic life adapts itself to its conditions. Gentleness
is of the essence not only of vegetable life but of
animal life. The violence even of beasts of prey is in-
cidental 5 without gentleness and sels-sacrifice they would
perish.

2. Organic life works through age—long process to new forms;
the changes of inorganic life mark little progress.

This power of instiation, characteristic of all organic
life, must mark fitness for the Kingdorn.

3. Organic life has capacity for greater difference, and also
closer union, than inorganic. These characteristics are
intensest in rnen, in whom the profoundest difference is
marked by personality, and the closest union becomes
brotherhood.

Human brotherhood is shown (a) in services to others rendered
incidentally in furthering one’s own ends (not a distinctively
human function), and (b) in services consciously rendered to the
collective good at the sacrifice of private good. This is ‹lis-
tinctively human, and must characterise the ideal man and the
ideal society.

Man must have this perfect social temper before he is fit for the
perfect earthly environment.

These characteristics will be found to conform to the ethic of the
Beatitudes.

Further, the close union of man with man must be completed by
the sense of union with God and response to the divine appeal

for sympathy.
