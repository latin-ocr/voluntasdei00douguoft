xx VOLUNTAS DEI

Thus, if one could believe the perfection of life conditions could
corne about catastrophically to-morrow, it would be necessary to
believe men in existence to-day who possessed the characteristics
approved in the whole teachings of the Gospels. Before that
perfection come about, and after, these characteristics must in-
creasingly obtain.

Individual weal must consist in the exercise of these characteristics‚
and they are identical with those Jesus preached as necessary to
participation inJ‘ the Kingdom.⁷'

CHAPTER XIII
Wfflu. oF SPEC1ES OR RAcE

Perfection of the individual in isolation does not satisfy us, sor if
all things fulfil one purpose, variety must end in vital unity and
individual perfection of the universe. As a stage toward this is
involved the perfection of the race.

The individual, both in this life and the next, must be in relation
with the life of the whole, for out of all relation he would cease
to exist.

Analogy to the constitution of the physical universe, any member
of which, if it could get outside the range of gravitation, etc„
would, so far as we know, cease to exist as an individual.

Attraction of man for man is analogous to the attraction of
physical particle for particle.

The sels that would isolate itself from the influence of all other
solves is more liable to disintegrate than the self that is governed
entirely by the spirit of age or class.

God's purpose sor humanity on earth and beyond being one purpose,
the unity of the race on earth must be perpetuated beyond death,
human beings always, everywhere, co-operating with God to

accomplish His purpose, or, possibly, defying that purpose to
their own spiritual disintegration.

CHAPTER XIV

UN1V1-:RsAL WEAL

The universal weal is the weal of God.

We can only think of God positively in relation to our universe,
as the source of its energy, the architect of its progressi, the
sharer of its suffering, the ruler of its perfected condition, revealed

through a human life perfectly at one with Himself‚ as the sun
is revealed through its photosphere.
