CHAPTER XVIII

CHRISTIAN UNITY

We assume in the universe a unity of purpose.

Hence we assume that things and persons sharing a common nature have a
community of origin and destiny.

Analysis of the nature of the unity possible to personS.

lllustrated in the low form of unity possible to devils—128. the unconscious
and involuntary unity of centres of a common life, which all receive and
emit similar impulses. The deviI, being degenernte, tends to greater same-
ness with his fellows and to incapacity for conscious union.

All Christians necessarily have the lower degree of involuntary and uncon-
scious union with each other7 for they receive and transmit similar im-
pulses 3 but the higher degree of union‚ conscious and voluntary, with some
outward organisation, is necessary for efficiency.

The Christian life tends to ever greater variety and ever closer union.

Christendom has always recognised need of union.

Three epochs in history of Christendom :—
(a) That of embryonic and unrecognised divergence.
(b) That of the use of constraint to suppress divergence.
(c) That of recognised divergence and lack of voluntary union.

The achievement of voluntary union with adequate scope for variety still lies
before the Church.

The “things of God” thus demanding the greatest distinction and closest
union in men, we may find an explanation of Christian disunion in our
mistaken conception of “the things of God ” for which religious parties
fight.

Looking impartially, we can usually see that in such controversy God is on
both sides, while He can only identify Himself fully with that divine ideal
of right embodied in the life of Jesus and with the coming Kingdom which
is its fulfilment.

In so far as we can discover and practise the righteousness that belongs to
that Kingdom we shall realise the real unity in diversity of all faithful
men.

Misinterpreting “the things of God‚’' we have missed the significance of the
Cross, not seeing that to suffer with the world has always been the glory
of God.

A religion and civilisation concentrated on the defence of a good already
attained were bound to be opposed to a forward-looking Christ.
