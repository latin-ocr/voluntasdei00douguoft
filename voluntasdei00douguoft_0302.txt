270 VOLUNTAS DEI emp,

they may be the development of what in earlier
stages were impulses of mere ambition or adventure,
but this does not make them one whit less trust—
worthy as pointers if we admit the hypothesis of
divine purpose.

We need a more explicit doctrine as to the
synthesis of the spiritual and the physical excel-
lence of the race, the synthesis of all that humanity
may attain to in the highest heaven and all that
it may attain to in an earthly state. If God's
purpose ainis at both these they must each of them
be contingent on the other; humanity cannot
reach perfection in a spiritual realm without having
reached the earthly perfectiori, nor can humanity
reach its earthly perfection without moving ⁴along
those lines which lead to the spiritual consumma-
tion. A religious society that does not perceive
the necessity for this synthesis presents somewhat
the appearance of a disturbed ant—hill ; for instead
of each individual in the community going on
with activities which contribute to the welfare of
the whole, the energies of many a member of the
community are distracted by not knowing whether
flight from the home of the community or the
immediate reparation of the home is the better
course to pursue. Thus it is possible to see a
modern saint running on a pilgrimage for some time
with the intention of separating himself from
material interests, and then, feeling that he is on the
wrong track‚ running to immerse himself again in
the material interests of the community so deeply
that he loses the full impulse of the extra-physical
motive.
