INTRODUCTION 7

the assumption that the musician, as the force of
life—wisdom, by constantly working upon the matter
of the piano must have produced its present con-
struction, must have beaten out his sonatas and

jecting on the heavens its own likeness—like the
Brocken spec-tre--into whose lips it naturally puts
one voice of its own dialectic. The sonatas of the
mystic piano may well represent not only the tumult
of human passions and efforts, but the multitudi-

Pacific island in a glass—bottomed boat, will know
that the fish ofa thousand iridescent tints diving
