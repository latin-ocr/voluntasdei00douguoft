toward the crystal that only forms itself in stillness‚
as a nurse is restrained and delicate toward a
sleeping babe lest it awake. If this be true, if
fatherhood be the best symbol of Omnipotence,
I should like in the next chapters to consider
what the divine self-revelation to humanity would
naturally be.
