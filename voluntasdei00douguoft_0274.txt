permitting devils to resist His will while they

will must work.

But the godly will is ex hypothesi the channel
of fuller life and therefore tends to ever greater
and greater variety, and at the same time to ever
closer unity, while the devils’ will must, by the
same law, tend to greater sameness and greater
separation.

I argued in an earlier chapter that all along the
line of evolution progress is toward greater differ-

passion for conscious and voluntary union with
other spirits, and an intellectual thirst for unity in
all things ; and that this passion attains its greatest
height in persons who attain to the greatest dis-

being much greater difference between men of
genius—even if the genius be for sainthood—-than
there is between children or rustics or the feeble-

points of union with its kind. We see the same
thing in deviations from the normal that reach
the point of degeneracy. Degeneracy in species
means loss of function and vitality. The degene-
rate human individual shows no great difference
from his fellow-degenerates, but tends to be self-
